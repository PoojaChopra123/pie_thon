The croissants were a little disappointing as they were not so French and more of the American style. They did not have many thin layers and are more bready, heavy and dense. Overall the pastries that I has are just the average but I am willing to try other things they have next time.\",\n",

I walked in and reviewed the menu on the wall. Right away a gentlemen came up to me from the back in street clothes and asked if I had any questions. I had a lot of questions. Robert had every answer from time of day everything was prepperd. To the cost of each item I inquired to the penny. He gave me a sample of their version of a donut hole and it was amazing. I grabbed my wife the butter and sugar crepes, chocolate croissant and a hot chocolate. After leaving I was left with such a good impression. I walked back in and asked his name and told him I was so appreciative and impressed by his customer service. My wife and I are both managers at separate restaurants within the city. Most importantly my wife and her friend loved the baked items. We will be back. Thank you Robert for your above and beyond commitment to excellence.

On a whim on our way out of town this morning we stopped in, in hopes of a breakfast sandwich and my first impression was how charming and social this place is. There were many conversations and work meetings going on, giving this place a warm and casual feel. I ordered the Normandie (croissant, egg, onions, tomato, Brie) and my guy got the Nordic (croissant, egg, avocado, greens, salmon). We grabbed a table and had only a short wait until they brought our plates out. My sandwich was fabulous, definitely would order again, but my guy didn't like his and thought the flavors were a bit off together. I also think it was rather overpriced, he was still hungry after his sandwich and wanted a plain croissant but it was $4, $25 on two small breakfast sandwiches and a croissant is a bit much in my opinion so we passed. Can't give more stars because this place was dirty. Several tables needed to be wiped down, the coffee bar was littered, there were only a few cups left to serve yourself water and each one I flipped was visibly dirty but only semi busy. They also had a basket out on the counter of croquettes with a sign that said \\\"freshly baked croquettes!\\\" which to me and several others read as \\\"sample me\\\" but that was not the case and the staff seemed surprised and corrected us. Sorry but a basket of small hand food with a sign that boasts about them being fresh definitely makes it look like a sample! And for the price I wouldn't buy the pastries without trying them first so it seemed smart to have samples. When all is said and done, this place is charming and I liked my sandwich but I wish it had been cleaner or more reasonably priced. I'm sure living in the neighborhood I'll be back to try more, hopefully next time the weather will cooperate and I can sit outside in their adorable little patio.\",\n",

On my most recent trip back to the Ravenswood neighborhood to visit family, I discovered just how far removed my perception was from reality.La Boulangerie is a simple, relaxed, casual spot that served up a very tasty meal. I had a bacon and egg croissant and my girlfriend had the Nordic, a croissant served with salmon. Her mom had a plain croissant and coffee. I and my girlfriend enjoyed lattes.Our breakfast sandwiches were heartier than I expected, the croissants were fresh and fairly good sized. The greens were crisp, and the lattes were rich and flavorful.We ordered pastries to take back to Ohio. The macaron variety was plentiful and a bit on the pricey side, but they were fresh and flavorful. My girlfriend highly recommended the almond croissant, though I opted for chocolate and some raspberry pastries to give as a gift.I enjoyed the casual atmosphere here. It was bright and cheery, even when it was rainy and overcast outside. We ate at community tables with bench seating, but it was easy to enjoy conversation without having to strain to hear. The people were friendly, too--patrons and employees alike. This was an enjoyable, filling breakfast meal. I will be happy to come back on the next trip!\",\n",

They are SO good at what they're good at... but they struggle so much in other areas that - if they got right - would make them crush it.Their croissants and other baked goods are so so so lovely and scrumptious.....But the second you switch to ordering prepared foods, things have a tendency to fall apart. Obviously these are first world problems but here are recent examples: \\u00a0Ordered a lemon crepe from the menu.... when it came it was plain and the manager said \\\"oh sorry we are out of lemon.\\\" Did they know that when we ordered? Or did it happen after? Why not communicate that to us and give us an option to reorder? Ordered a crepe dish and asked them for Brie instead of mozzarella inside... \\\"no problem\\\" - but it came with mozzarella (and barely warm inside and egg on top was not adequately cooked). Our four dishes came at very different times... my kids were done w their breakfast by the time mine came. Bottom line- it feels like they are one person short and that communication internally could be improved, s'il vous plait!!!\",\n",

The veggie special was in dire need of salt- there was so little brie! They forgot the brie entirely on the Normandie sandwich I ordered, and had put less than a teaspoon of caramelized onions on the entire sandwich. The nice lady behind the kitchen counter gave me extra brie when I returned it. It's not that the sandwiches are inedible, not at all, just lacking in something! Perhaps because I am ordering the vegetarian sandwiches? I feel like the addition of one or two more ingredients or sauces, etc would make them stellar.But go! for! the! pastries!\",\n",

Maybe he is one of the owners and i just have to deal with him whenever I want to have their croissant!

The macarons were priced at $2.25 a piece, which is on par with their competition. They boasted a large variety of flavors, ranging from floral to fruity to chocolatey, and both my friend and I noted that the macarons are much larger than normal. Either way, we completely devoured our entire box in one sitting :) My only complaint is that they offer a 5-piece box for $11.90, which is confusing because $2.25 (the price per individual macaron) x 5 macaron = $11.25 total, so you're essentially paying more for a box instead of getting a deal. Weird...Parking is a little difficult, but it's steps away from the Damen Brown Line, which makes it simple to access. I will be adding La Boulangerie to my list of dessert rotations for sure!\",\n",

Even when not fresh as the crust would crack in flakes, the cookie was still soft to the bite with a distinctive chew bounce, just the way I like them. The ganache is not too sweet but flavorful and creamy. I've tried the pistachio and chocolate- both were good. Just wish they were a bit fresher so the outer shell would be softer.Also tried chocolate croissant and a regular croissant. Both while warm, which warms your souls as you bite in. The only thing I'd have to come back for is to see if the croissant has more inner layers when cooled as they stick and taste a bit bread-like when warm. The outer crust is perfectly browned and delicately crisp. Pretty sure this will be my go to for macaron craving days from now on. A bit on the expensive side though at $2.25 a pop.\",\n",

Upon entering the establishment I was warmly greeted by the guy behind the counter who asked me what I wanted to order. Since it was my first time in the place I asked for a minute to review the menu. He politely told me to take my time and whenever I was ready he would take my order. Perfect. At no point did I feel rushed or pressured to order quickly. After placing my order I waited for a few minutes and then was presented my sandwich in a neatly folded white paper bag.Bottom line - if I am in the neighborhood again I will definitely sample other items on the menu and hope they are as tasty as my morning breakfast sandwich.\",\n",

It has both outdoor and inside seating tables. I genuinely like that there were small macaron samples in the cashier section that customers could try. The price is pretty fair as three macarons, one butter croissant, one chocolate croissant, and one flan cake cost us $15. The croissants are simply out of this world; especially the butter croissant, which I might confidently say it was very authentic French. The texture and surface of the Macaron cookie are silky smooth and chunky, while the cookie's texture beneath the crust is chewy, light, and soft. The filling cream is smooth, sufficient firm just like ganache, and not sticky. However, sugar took over in all of the macarons that we had, which are Dark Chocolate Hazelnut, Pistachio, and regular Chocolate. Sadly, I hardly tasted the flavor and was unable to tell which was Hazelnut and which was Chocolate because of the over sweetness. My friend did not enjoy the flan cake too much. It was smooth, apparently, but the texture was firm. All in all, we will definitely be back here for an ideal Sunday morning just to have a butter croissant and a cup of hot French roasted coffee.\",\n",

The cappuccino was lovely, the community seating was fine, the menu was small and concise. After coffee, I wanted to order a sandwich. I went with the Parisian. The bread was crusty like it should be, but maybe a little too crusty. It hurt my mouth. The ham was great. The cheese was great, but all three together was maybe a little too pricey with a $7 and some change bill. No sides and the size of the sandwich was average.\",\n",

Stopped in at 8 am on a Saturday and they literally had 3 chocolate and 3 plain croissants left. No ham and cheese croissants, no other 'sandwich' type croissants. Literally 6 items in the giant case. I don't know if they were baking them, I don't know if someone got in to work that morning really late, but when I asked, the guy kind of sheepishly said no, that was all they had. I think the people behind me were bummed that I bought 2 of the 3 chocolate ones... That being said, the croissants were excellent. So was the quiche lorraine (they did have a lot of quiche available to choose from). They lose a star for the uneven availability of their goods, and lose another 1.5 stars for the price. I get that the food is good, but the prices are astronomical. You've heard the theory about millenials' inability to buy a house and avocado toast? This is the same thing, but with croissants. My 2 croissants and 1 piece of quiche was $14.50 (including tax). When I was just out of college, I could never afford to get breakfast or lunch here on a regular basis.Great place for an occasional treat of authentic French food and pastries - yes I've been to France 3 times, and going again this summer - just know that everything on their menu might not be available, and is quite expensive.\",\n",

My biggest complaint is that it is overpriced. For example, a simple butter and sugar crepe here will set you back $6. These are ubiquitous in France and can be bought for a couple euros from a street cart, or even in the US food carts will sell a basic crepe for $3. Other items on the menu are similarly overpriced. I'm definitely happy to see this type of business in the neighborhood, so I will continue to support them. However, the value for the money isn't as good. The only other thing to be aware of is that parking is tough. I live in the neighborhood, so we usually walk. But for those driving allow extra time to park.\",\n",

If you're off your diet try the bourgeoius breakfast sandwich. Of course the fresh baked baguettes are excellent. The quiche is also delicious. I have found all the staff to be really nice, polite and quick -- even when the line is out the door. The atmosphere is nice. French language everywhere adds to the cafe's charm. Decorated in cute, quirky industrial decor. A very smart feature: every table has outlets for your device. My only complaint is that the heat is pretty intense, but they never seem to mind when I open a window near my seat. This place is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood.\",\n",

The food and drinks are listed on boards behind the counters, and all the signage is clear and easy to read. Prices are listed as well, so you don't get any sticker shock surprises.The seating is well thought out and arranged well. I've always managed to find a place to sit and hang out for an hour or so, and I've never felt crowded or hemmed in.There is an French feel to the staff and the food, beyond the name. Well, at least as authentic as it can be to a Midwesterner who's never actually been in France. However, the owners and some staff members are clearly native French. They speak in French to each other, but also speak English very well. The authentic French accent is nice to hear. It does lend a touch of authenticity to the store. Since it's located next to the French school, you also get a lot of students here who speak French to the staff. Of course, you might not like to be around a lot of students, because they are loud and rambunctious. It depends what time of day you come in. The treats especially are as rich and full of butter as Julia Child could ever want. That seems French to me, too.What's inconsistent are the sandwiches and even the quiches. A quick example: I ordered a quiche on a recent Friday. I was very impressed that the staff person took it to an oven to be heated. Not a microwave! I thought this boded well for my lunch. When I ate the quiche, parts were warm, parts were lukewarm, and the bottom was clammy and wet. No soggy bottoms, please! Disappointing.The coffee is good.For pastries and coffee, the quality is pretty high and consistent. The food, on the other hand . . . you just never know what you are going to get.\",\n",

The second time they forgot to warm it up (and I was too lazy to go back and it was still pretty good cold, but nowhere *as* good).

La Boulangerie is, in my opinion, the perfect representation of all that is wonderful about the food scene in Chicago - diverse, daring and delicious! This is a charming little French cafe/bakery, and the minute you step in, you feel like you've been transported to an actual boulangerie on Boulevard St Germain, Paris. These guys serve up some amazing sandwiches here. My wife and I both ordered \\\"Le Wisconsin\\\" which consisted of herbed chicken, brie, apple butter, avocado and some greens. Not only is Brie my favorite cheese but when you take a bite of it mixed in with chicken and apple butter, you get this intense foodgasm. Seriously. Do try this sandwich, or go for the Atlantic (smoked salmon, horseradish aioli and egg) which is my next sandwich on the hit list. I also saw crepes and quiches on the menu, and will have to try those out next weekend. Also, they serve La Colombe coffee which is second only to Dark Matter coffee in my opinion. ALSO, they also offer a selection of amazing French grocery items. Galettes anyone??? How about rillettes de canard (delicious preparation of duck meat similar to p\\u00e2t\\u00e9)? Bonbons???Lastly, I absolutely love the seating in this cafe. They have one long bench in addition to the classic Parisian cafe chairs you would have found Hemingway lounging on in Paris. If you are looking for a beautiful, little cafe to study, chat or just get a taste of France, do come here and you will not be disappointed!\",\n",

I thought I had found my new sandwich haunt, but getting mediocre food 66.6% of the time has made me leery.The water available for guests is also rarely kept cool. I did like the breakfast croissants too, although they were prepared really inconsistently from one visit to another.Here's hoping they can up their quality control and workflow in a few months and we'll give it another try to see if it's improved.\",\n",

While the name (Bakery) is somewhat predictable, it only seems appropriate given the authentic food offerings. The crowd was at least half French speaking - possibly staff from the adjoining Lycee Francais School. \\u00a0We went to this new - barely open for a month - location. Street parking on a side street was easy. It's a pretty and bright place in a newish office building. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 THE GOOD: The menu selections and quality of the pastries and sandwiches felt very authentic and are deliciously displayed. Both sandwiches and pastries we tried were meticulously prepared bringing back memories of youthful years in France - like walking into an updated mini version of Paris' renowned Le Drugstore of yesteryear. They do not take shortcuts to achieve high marks for both authenticity and quality. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 THE NOT QUITE READY FOR PRIME TIME: Well, while faced with a long waiting line during prime lunch hour, the line moved rather swiftly towards the cashier. However, the tracking of orders was a mess as we observed about eight of ten orders only reaching their final table necessitating several 'inquiry' stops. Likewise, there is no signage to find the bathrooms - shared across the corridor with the office building - and, once found, one is prompted to go back to ask for the code to the lock.CB\",\n",

Finally today I had some time to go. I knew in advance that I wanted a pain au chocolat, which is what I ordered. The chocolate was tasty, but the \\\"pain\\\" (croissant part of the pastry) was two thumbs down. It looked perfect, had a price tag that said, \\\"I will be nothing but perfection\\\", which I did not mind because I knew that it would be just as it is in France...but sadly was not. No crunch or flake. I ate the chocolate and put the pain, painfully, in the bin.Then why the 5 \\u00e9toiles? The baguette. The baguette. It's somehow so hard, outside of Europe, to find a great baguette. I've heard that it's something about the water - who knows. En tout cas, La Boulangerie has either imported the water for their baguette or made the Chicago water its slave because their baguette is everything that baguette dreams are made of and more... For every disappointing baguette that we've all bought at Trader Joe's, Mariano's, Whole Foods and even the slew of specialty bakeries across Chicago - we have earned La Boulangerie's baguette perfection...(notable exception: the baguette at Sofitel's Caf\\u00e9 des Architectes which I believe is courtesy of La Fournette). So: welcome to Lincoln Square - I'll see you every time I am looking for perfection in bread.\",\n",

I remembered my delightful breakfast sandwich and rushed back to have it again...but it wasn't on the menu. My Maple Spice syrup was gone too.But! The service I got was comparable to my previous experiences, my chocolate tart was also equally good, and the smoked salmon sandwich I ordered was still good...just not what I wanted.I'll go back again sometime for the baked goods, but I think I'll stick to other places nearby for creative sandwiches and coffee instead.Original Review:They have a Gourmet Breakfast Sandwich that is smoked salmon, a fried egg, avocado, mixed greens, and Dijon mustard on a croissant.

So I really do understand customer service BUT. I really do want to applaud this place for getting me back into loving Macaroons again. There are numerous places that do make them but most dont make the cut. This place, I want to say is on top of my list and definitely back for more.The reason for my minus stars is the lady working there at the moment. It was not busy and around 4-5pm. I came in looking for a snack and so I tried the macaroons. Great texture, perfectly super sweet and great tasting. So back to the service. Just that when I asked her about eclairs that didnt have chocolate on top, she looked at me quite judgmental just replying no they only have eclairs like this. I guess I am not the only one who received this type of service. Like she wanted to hurry me up, and if I was deciding on what I wanted, she looked annoyed. (I understand too that people can be so picky and annoying but if the customer was polite or didn't bother her until she was ready to order, shouldn't you be a little nicer?)Conclusion. Good macaroons Bad customer serviceWill be back for macaroons cravings so hopefully this isn't an issue.\",\n",

Here's a breakdown of my review.Ambience: The place is clean and displays look neat. I'm just hoping to have that buttery fresh baking smell when you go inside a bakery. 4.5/5Service: So the young lady that helped me was really nice and just jolly. I was the only one at the store at that time and told her some interesting facts about French desserts. She was so happy and gave me a free financier since I was undecided that day and she really wants me to taste it. I hope I got her name but she looks a lil bit like Sersei from GOT. 5/5 or higher if only I can.Desserts: I got the Lavender Macaron And the lemon Financier. The Macaron is borderline sweet for me. Maybe just a tiny bit cut from sugar but nonetheless still enjoyable. The financier is fantastic. Just right soft, buttery and moist cake. Definitely would go back there for Financier. 4.8/5Pricing: this post is a late one so I can't remember exact price but I remember they are on a pricier side but it is acceptable because La boulangerie use quality products in making their desserts and French desserts. Compared to other French pattiserries, they're competitive price. 5/5.The service of Ms. Sersei gave this place an unforgettable experience and I will be back often just coz of that.\",\n",

True French baguettes get stale as the day passes that is why French people buy their baguettes early in the morning and store it in a air tight containers almost resembling a small trash bin. Now...you want a sandwich? Order their fixings on a CROISSANT. Their croissants are not super crispy and fall apart crumb trail as you eat like some bakeries. They are layered, buttery and flaky. When they moved from Logan Square to Lakeview, my old co-worker had me buy a dozen of their croissants. She would freeze them then toast them when she wanted one! Their desserts are my favorite (macaron Monday anyone?) and their baguettes I take home and heat it up slightly to make warm again with a bowl of water in the oven. That is the French trick folks! What have we learned:1. Order their sandwiches on a croissant.2. Buy in bulk and freeze for easy breakfast.3. Buy baguettes early in the morning or take it home to warm. (Or just suck it up and eat the baguette like a true European. Softer the bread, more chemicals it has anyways think... Wonderbread. )\",\n",

I really like the food at this place, so I am sad to stop ordering from them. But the lack of hospitality really rubbed me the wrong way.\",\n",

Large portion as well, only managed to finish 3/4.The turkey club: Boyfriend said it was really good and he is picky when it comes to sandwiches.The chocolate croissant was amazing. Decadent, clearly made with good butter and with an intense dark chocolate filling. If you get one of these delivered, warm it up in the oven for a couple minutes- heaven.\",\n",

I met up with a partner from an acting class to read through our lines for a scene together. We ordered 4 macaroons and a beverage, paying about $20, which in my opinion is way too expensive. There was only 1 other patron in the restaurant when my scene partner and I were ordering, and they left soon after we sat down. The macaroon was excellent, the dos off putting thing cam from the staff. One hefty ginger woman was working. She was nice when taking our order, but turned out to be the worst part of the place. The lines that my scene partner and I were rehearsing weren't harsh, they didn't have any swearing and we weren't yelling or talking loud. Since we were the only ones there, it was easy to hear each other. We almost reach the end of our lines when I hear \\\"Can you guys tone it down, or stop or just get out? cause thats really disturbing me\\\" Mind you, what we were disturbing with our chatter, was her FaceTime call to her friend complaining about her divorce and how her husband left her, as well as her texting sessions that took place the entire time we were there. My friend even tipped her, and to be addressed so rudely from such a nasty woman was not only off-putting but so unprofessional, which added to her unprofessionalism by texting her whole shift and face timing her friend to cry. Im sorry, but do that stuff off the clock. No one wants to deal with bitter people who have awful personal lives, then bring that attitude to work with them. Like I said, the macaroon was delicious and the ambiance was so adorable, but I will definitely not be returning due to their sub-par staff.\",\n",

Chicken, avocado, Brie, apple butter, \\u00a0sounds pretty safe. I knew something had to be up when my sandwich only took a minute. Here it is. A whole dry hard baguette (how am I supposed to eat a whole dry loaf of bread) --dry shaved chicken like out of the can! No avocado, and two chunks of Brie slapped on there. My boyfriends no cook but even he'd know to put mayo and pepper on there to disguise the mess going on. Im not sure if the apple butter was in it or not. Unless that dot salmon pur\\u00e9e is it.

Bottom line: I was served Quiche blackened underneath with charcoal and grime, not once, but three times, by the same, callous employee. When I brought it to his notice, this is what happened.I used to like La Boulangerie a lot, have been going there for couple of years now because it's on my way to the Belmont stop. The place was formerly attended by a friendly Spanish couple who cared deeply about serving the customers, were involved and engaged. Their croissants and quiches are great and the coffee used to be good too. Besides, it was also a good place to sit and work.I guess there was a change of management about 6 months back or so, and everything started going downhill. They don't even have a proper espresso machine any more, so you can't really order a cappuccino or macchiato. But it was a Monday morning incident that sealed the fate of this caf\\u00e9 \\u00a0for me. It had to do with a callous, indolent and rude employee by the name of Mike (or that's what he told me his name was). The first time he served me a slice of quiche, it was totally blackened underneath from charcoal that came from the oven. I told him politely, and he apologized. The second time around when the same thing happened, I was annoyed but told him politely again, and he apologized, saying that he'll be more careful next time. But it should have become obvious to me that he really didn't care. When he did the same thing to me the THIRD time, and this time I confronted him, instead of apologizing or even acknowledging his mistake, he assumed a brazen and defensive attitude and told me \\\"Now, what do you want to do man?\\\" as if challenging me. Neither did he offer to serve me another quiche, nor did he give me a refund, but instead walked away with the plate of grimy quiche into the kitchen when I asked him his name, and said, \\\"Go, write a review on yelp, or call the manager...\\\" and then muttered something insulting that I couldn't catch. By then, I had picked up my bag and was on the way out. The place used to be great, but the service has fallen significantly since the management changed hands. I'll never go back there again.\",\n",

We ordered the turkey club and the caprese along with a coffee and chocolate croissant. The sandwiches were very good and made on in-house, freshly baked bread. The turkey was actually roasted and the aioli gave it some extra zest. The croissant was delicious, so I imagine the army of macaroons and other baked goods in their display case are equally good. Service was a tad slow, but they were very busy and you could tell they were working really hard to serve everyone in a timely manner.Great place to spend a relaxing afternoon munching on a sandwich and a couple sweet treats!\",\n",

Our main courses were the 'classic' bacon egg and cheese sandwich. I got mine on fresh and fluffy ciabatta bread while my partner got it on a savory hot crepe! We loved it! Once again, simple, but solid and straightforward. This is a Bakery. The emphasis is on the quality of the delicious breads/baked goods and everything we had was spot on. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, explaining the expansive menu to us newcomers! The space is intimate and chic. Not very conducive to big groups but great for a quiet respite or a one-on-one. Also, if you know what you want, you can order ahead for pickup or delivery through grub hub. All in all a great option. I walked out and felt pity for the folks standing in a long line at Ann Sather while a quality meal was waiting for them right next door in La Boulangerie. Check it out everyone!\",\n",

This might be due to the fact that there was only one employee working at the time and she probably felt a little rushed. But the sandwich tasted good, which is the most important thing.The peach almond tart was good. But it wasn't as good as it looked, unfortunately. I didn't get the feeling that it was freshly baked that day either. I'd like to try some of their other pastries, though. There was quite a bit of variety for such a small store.\",\n",

The regular sandwiches cost little more than similar foods on the street but that is totally a french/fancy upcharge and the breakfast looks so good so I'm guessing you get what you pay for on those. The bread has to be super fresh at the point making for the best egg sandwiches ever. The staff was super nice and the location is really small so it has a homey, welcoming feel.

Yes, that is a traditional French baguette but made with wonderfully smoky bacon and nutty cheese, made fresh in the bakery and available for only 4.50. A total steal. This bread was amazing. So fresh, crusty on the outside that falls into a nice softness inside. And catching a bit of bacon or cheese just elevates it even more. Mod Dieu--see it's so good it has me speaking French!So I also bought some Macarons to share and found them to be quite good as well. I sampled the Lavender, Raspberry and Passion Fruit. The flavors were true it's name--the filling is my favorite part. The meringue shell had a bit of crunch, but a tad too soft for me. \\u00a0They are still very good--I wouldn't say no to them at all. The bakery is full of wonderful freshly made choices--the financier and Diplomate (croissant bread pudding)--look really good. \\u00a0They also offer sandwiches, crepes to order and a really good cafe au lait. It's very small inside so I kind of felt like I was too close to the diners--I hope they didn't mind. Service is super friendly.\",\n",

OMG! Their baguette is seriously to die for. Now, I've made a promise to myself that I'd cut back on my carbs, but I cannot will myself to stay away from their regular baguette. It tasted so fresh and so warm. It was crunchy on the outside and super soft on the inside. This past Sunday I finally tried their croissants....Just end it for me now. I can now die happy. I had a chocolate croissant and it had just the right amount of chocolate (don't hate me, but I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate) and the croissant itself is buttery, and flakey in the best way possible. And they were huge!By the time I hit their stand it was time to pack up so they were selling the left over croissants buy one get one free. That's my kind of deal! I'll definitely have to check out their shop.\",\n",

Seriously, a great French baguette is life changing like meeting Oprah or Warren Buffet. We've read several articles and Yelp lists that say La Boulangerie has authentic French pastries and bread. The fiance and I finally made a trip here early Saturday night. The place is much smaller than I anticipated. My eyes lit up when I saw they had fresh French baguettes with a chalk board indicating when the last baguette was baked. The menu has sandwiches, crepes and salads. We're excited to have a jambon beurre (ham and butter) sandwich. Unfotunately, they didn't have it on the menu. \\u00a0However, the friendly cashier seemed excited we were asking for it and made us a jambon beurre using proscuitto instead. It was like we were being transported back into Paris! So good!! I cannot wait to come back this week for a baguette and order a salad or crepes while there!! Now only if they had a location close to me...\",\n",

The pastries are also great if you have a sweet tooth. The Eclaires and Macaroons are personal favorites.\",\n",

I ordered the Wisconsin. It was delicious. The big, chewy baguette was loaded with herbed chicken, brie, apple butter, avocado and field greens. One of the best cold sandwiches I've had in downtown Chicago in a long, long time. For $8.00 and a $2.50 (tax included, and they accept credit cards) Cannele pastry, heaven was right there before me. It's a shame the truck only comes 'round on a Monday or a Wednesday and leaves at 1 p.m. This truck could become a daily staple. So yummy!\",\n",

We decided to wait around--we could see the person working sitting at a table with a friend (I'm guessing). At 8:20 we came back and the door was still locked and the employee was still sitting at the table. He came over and unlocked the door and let us know they were closed for a little break. He told us they were out of crepes so we left with the peanut butter tart. It was really delicious and the bread looked good too. I was a little disappointed that they were out of crepes and didn't really believe him. I am guessing he didn't feel like making them. I would maybe go back and try their bread. Maybe they won't be out of crepes then.\",\n",

I was walking to Starbucks on the corner of Belmont & Halsted/Clark. As I pass thru I see one of the employees making what appeared to be a sweet crepe. I am a sucker for a good crepe so I made a mental note to walk back and peep inside. I did and I asked for a banana crepe (they ran out of strawberries but I'm not finicky about food so whatever) and to get that strawberry essence I got some strawberry syrup in it and that took good care for my need of a strawberry/banana combo. Very well done and best of all-- NOT OVERLY SWEET! Most places I've been to make their sweet crepes way too sweet ending with me leaving half behind to be taken home to give away or thrown out. Ate this sucker up! And I feel content. I will be returning with my beloved if I like it he is willing to try it out and I give this place a A. Ps: bought macarons! 5 for 9.99 since each are $1.90. Be a daredevil and try it out :-) but I think the mornings would be more fitting to come here. Marking my alarm the day before coming here for a crepe/lunch date! Might even go for their quiche\",\n",

Coffee, breakfast sandwiches, baguettes, pastries, and macarons are neatly scribbled across a huge blackboard lodged behind and above the counter. Macarons are $1.50 each. I visited on a Tuesday and the flavors offered were chocolate, chocolate lavender, strawberry white chocolate, pistachio, key lime, and salted caramel.I also bought four pieces of intricately made pastries at $6.50 each. With the price came all sorts of fanciness. I bought the key lime, mango mousse, and white chocolate mousse. Despite their different flavors, they share a few commonalities. Each has a custard-like filling with a sweet subtleness clinging onto bits of fruits. They stood approximately two inches tall with two delicate pieces of chocolate atop. The favorite was the white chocolate mousse. The key lime and mango mousse were a bit too sour and citrusy. The flavors and ingredients weren't the richest but this could be the ideal place for a quick catch-up on work or to read. The caf\\u00e9 was homey and quiet the both times I paid a visit.\",\n",

We were rushing down Belmont to try to catch a Red line train, but we had to pause for the peculiar. There's a French bakery on Belmont? Eh?We hesitated to go in, but the door was wide open. There was an L-shaped pastry case and a persuasive, jovial French man behind it facing the entryway. He was explaining the shop, how they just opened, \\\"freshly-baked\\\", and etc. to another customer. The setup was almost as good as a classic, walk-up bakery window.Meanwhile, my sister and I had laser focus on the same thing... the MACARONS ($1.50 each). We decided to purchase a pistachio one to share and quickly eat in the store. The table seating wasn't comfortable, but any annoyances melted away because the macaron instantly became the focus of unadulterated delight. The slightly crispy outside and melt-in-your-mouth sweet goodness was awesome. Seriously, I think time stopped.Then, two other staffers encouraged us to taste the bread before we left. I'm so glad that we didn't pass up that opportunity either. The bite of the PARMESAN CIABATTA ($4 full loaf, $2 half loaf) was delicious. I decided that this was how bread should taste. What crap had I been buying? Even bread I'd made didn't taste as good. Was it a fluke? I don't know. Yet the first experience was enough for me to put La Boulangerie Cafe on the \\\"will return\\\" list to find out.\",\n",

The canele I bought was old-tasting, not at all custardy, and not caramelized as it should be...it was just plain burnt. \\u00a0 I literally spit it out. \\u00a0 Save your money, and head to Floriole or Bad Wolf instead.\",\n",

Open not even a week when I visited, this bakery/cafe serves Metropolis, Intelligentsia, and Julius Minel with its bake goods.

My complaints would include the air conditioning (didn't work so well in 90+ degree weather). We purposely chose a spot right by a vent, and it was better. The service was slow.

People crowding around where the register is at while waiting for their order and you just have to start pushing your way through to pay after pointing out what you want from the sweets up in front on the side. There's very little seating inside aka two small tables and there is no trash can inside if you are able to eat in, which we did... weird. So we took our trash from the bakery and walked down belmont to discard it. They have all kinds of croissants, sandwiches, overpriced nutella, and some good looking sweets. I tried a pistachio, caramel, and pumpkin macaron. The Pistachio was by far the best.. very good and chewy. I didn't like that it looks like they use a ton of food coloring because these are really bright, intensely colored macarons. I also tried a caramel cream puff with a pumpkin custardy cream inside. It's pretty good, I like the custard like filling because it reminds me of my much loved vanilla cream puffs from Lanvin, a french-vietnamese bakery in Portland. My friend's sandwich looked kind of good. I'm not particularly enticed to get one though. The bottom part of the bread is kinda badly burnt so she spent most of her time trying to tearing/scraping it off. Tsk Tsk.\",\n",

I should have known better and turned my ass around, \\u00a0walking out. But nooooo I wanted a croissant and decided to be a bit optimistic and positive. *sigh* My snobby side from within asked: What is this, a ghetto asian market? Minus the stank? Since flies were buzzing around the couple of small croissants that was left, I thought I'd try a crognut. Their version of the cronut. Service was indifferent and I had to ask for a bag. Do you mind? I don't exactly want to walk down belmont towards broadway in 90 degree weather with a sugary pastry exposed to the sun, melting down into a syrupy mess. Does one not know that about sugar and heat, working in a bakery?! So Stupid. I also sampled a key lime macaron which was regrettable. Read: I totally regretted swallowing. If I wasn't a lady I'd spit it out ASAP. Dry heave it all out. It tasted really old and just.. nasty, not very key lime-ish either. Just tasted very stale with an old, musty taste in my mouth. Nice. I'd want my customers to sample that too, an awful tasting product. That'll make 'em swoon.The crognut; was it worth 5 bucks? HELL No. It was very average and didn't taste very fresh. Glorified, fried croissant in the shape of a donut if you ask me. Don't waste your time, it's not all that. If you're still curious, take a 5 dollar bill out and put a lighter to it and watch it burn.. that's what it'll feel like after you finish this pastry.Hot and stuffy bakery with barely mediocre goods and zombie service? Dead to me.\",\n",

Probably the best quiche I've ever had. I don't like quiche a lot and don't eat it often but I would return for their quiche. It was very tasty. Even crust was very well done! A+ for the yummy quiche.Service staff was very nice, fast and friendly. \\u00a0The bad thing about their customer service, however, is their price listing. \\u00a0They list a bunch of sandwiches in different groups on their menu board, but it only provides the customer with a price range for what each of the sandwiches in a particular group cost. I can't stand when a restaurant has a website with a menu on it but do not provide prices, but I'd never been to an actual restaurant that doesn't provide precise pricing for each item. It's like, \\\"you owe us somewhere between $7 or $8, but we won't tell you how much until you get rung up at the register.\\\" What??? Yes, sometimes I will opt to order the $7 sandwich instead of the $8 one if I'm on the fence and one is cheaper than the other or vice versa if I want one more than the other, but give me a price. Is that too bourgeois of me to ask? Yes, sometime people care about how much money they are spending. Crazy concept I know. Shmm...Prices are high considering that you don't get a lot of meat on your sandwiches. The quiche was $4 for a small slice, but it was priced fair given the portion size and time it takes to prepare so I think the quiche was priced well.I would return but probably only to buy some bread to take home, maybe try some of their delicious looking pastries and definitely for their yummy quiche!\",\n",

Their lattes are A-ok as well, but unfortunately only come in a small size and are quite pricey (close to $4). I don't mind the limited seating since I've only gotten carry-out. My main issue is that the sandwiches are very expensive and not very substantial. It would be nice if they came with a side and I think the vegetarian sandwiches would taste better on baguettes instead of ciabatta. On my most recent visit I got the mozzarella sandwich which came with dressing. It wasn't wrapped very well and by the time I got home both the sandwich and the bag were soaked with dressing. I've not tried the macarons but this seems like the place to get them, if you're a fan.\",\n",

All served on a nice piece of baguette. While I do think that it was a wonderful sandwich, I was lightly turned off by the fact that all of the sandwiches are pre-prepared, and then put on to the bread when you order it. Everything tasted fresh, but I prefer the good old method of watching my food get made in front of me. The sandwich was a little expensive, but it seemed like there was a good ratio of higher quality ratio of ingredients to make it worth it. Also, all of the sandwiches are served cold, but maybe they can toast them if you want? I did not try any of the deserts, but they all looked yummy.\",\n",

And as I've been on a crusade to find authentic croissants, I also bought 1 plain and 1 chocolate...of which the chocolate was dessert at lunch.But the croissant--Oh, the croissant--was divine!!...flaky, layered, buttery...oh! My Croissant Crusade is over! And although I hate to abuse such a treasure in the microwave, I will occasionally zap it for 10 seconds, adding only to its delicious texture! (I bought one for a cab driver friend of mine who usually has bought croissants from one of the large grocery stores. He asked if LaB's were better; I said, \\\"the [grocery store's] is called a crescent roll; LaB's are croissants!\\\" After tasting LaB's croissant, he said he'd never buy the other kind again.)

The sandwich meat is fluffed or made to appear to look like more, when in reality it is only about 3 pieces of meat. Not only that, the sandwiches sit out all day long and you can see them leaking liquids. I have had a couple of their sandwiches and they are not as good as they make them look.The croissants cost as much as a loaf of bread, and the pastries cost just as much if not more. If I could imagine the prices, I would cut them in half and say they were fair. A large bottle of water cost $4, a simple can of San Pelligrino or Coca Cola cost me $2. There is no comfortable seating and it is obviously not maintained well. The food would be good if it was lower priced, but they do not seem to know how to attract customers. One thing that struck me was that they sell waffles. Not only do they sell waffles, they sell a half waffle for 2 dollars and a whole waffle for 6 dollars. It's minor things like this that make you wonder how capable are these people are if they cannot do any math. The food taste good but when you hear the prices, you simply want to walk away before they try to convince you to buy something you don't want. The service is fine but they seem like they are just trying to take advantage of customers by not revealing the prices of things so I would look elsewhere on a street that is filled with energy and great places with reasonable prices.\",\n",

What kind of a food establishment is this place???The quiche was good, although it was lukewarm. It would have tasted better if hot. Although the price of $4/ small slice is overpriced. It wasn't amazing.the basil tomato soup was okay. The only reason I drank it was because it was hot & it was freezing outside.The chocolate croissant is small & only had a small portion of chocolate in it. We asked them to heat it up & they attempted to with their nonfunctioning oven/toaster.The chocolate eclair was almost $4. Small piece and was missing a wow factor. The filling was chocolate cream and was ok. The establishment has 2 small table with a total of 4 chairs. They had a small window seat that is quite narrow & will not fit a normal person's butt. Also the window seat was much higher than the small table that we were to eat off of. So you end up hunching over the table with your butt hanging off the \\\"window seat.\\\" They also DO NOT have a restroom. My friend who is 7 months pregnant needed to use the restroom & they declined. Really?? Who does that to a pregnant woman?Overall, not impressed by this place and would NOT recommend. It was very disappointing.\",\n",

I have yet to try the sandwiches so this review is only for the quiche and macaroons.Macaroons: $1.50 eachQuiche: $4/slice or a whole pie is $15.Macaroons were a little chewey and the flavors were nothing special: Rose, Cherry, Chocolate, Mint Chocolate, Pistachio, CarmelQuiche was alright, they gave it to me cold so I had to heat it up at home. I got a zuccini and goat cheese slice and the taste was pretty good, the downfall was that it was cold.I hope to come back to try more of the sandwiches. This place only gets 3 stars because of the cold quiche and chewey macaroons. I believe this place will take off - they're just starting off.Can't wait to come back!\",\n",

      "        \"review_text\": \"Very excited to see this place open. \\u00a0I remember when their Logan Square location was polling customers for possible names of their upcoming Belmont store, and was very excited at the prospect of instead of having to trek all the way west for my bread, I might be able to simply walk a few blocks and within minutes, have it in my stomach. \\u00a0Yummmmm.... So, when I saw the store open driving down Belmont, I nearly caused an accident pulling over, flipped on my flashers, and walked right in.First, the store is really nice - beautiful, in fact. \\u00a0They have beautiful sandwiches in the case, much like you might see in a bakery in Paris. \\u00a0Wonderful looking breads behind the counter, and even though I came in rather late, they had just taken a few baguettes out of the oven, and I was able to pick one up.So, this was their first day open, and I think they need to go through a little breaking in period, but the results, nevertheless, were very good. \\u00a0I saw a variety of breads behind the counter. \\u00a0There were plain and topped ciabatta, a variety of baguettes, epis, and batards. \\u00a0The \\\"specialty baguette\\\" wasn't labeled, so I had to ask what they had available, but ultimately, I decided on a cheese batard and an epi. \\u00a0I needed to point out which was the epi, since none of the four had heard of this bread shape before, but once I pointed out which I was talking about, and it had been retrieved from the shelf, the manager, I think, told me that in fact it was there for decoration, and although they could give me an epi, it wouldn't be up to their standards, an explanation which even now I still don't understand. \\u00a0But, they had some baguettes fresh out of the oven, so I happily went for one of those instead. \\u00a0(Point of being very nitpicky - and only because I bake my own bread - I think the single long slash down the middle of the baguette is a little lazy and appropriate for really, really wet doughs. \\u00a0If you can, I feel a baguette should have the typical beautiful baguette \\\"ears\\\" - but, I digress - I think a baguette can be as beautiful as it can be tasty.)The cheese batard was very good, but I think from earlier that day, and definitely up to par with their bread in Logan Square. \\u00a0The baguette was also very good, but I would say at this point not, maybe, excellent. \\u00a0I started to think their Logan Square location changed how they make the breads maybe 6-9 months ago, and I think this is the new, modified version. \\u00a0Don't get me wrong - there is nothing like bread fresh from the oven, and I relished each bite. \\u00a0This felt a bit like the bread had been made in less time - from start to finish - than maybe some other traditional baguettes (I think longer ferments allow for greater flavor and better results) - the crust was amazing - crisp, crackly, and just delicious. \\u00a0I tend to also like tangier baguettes, and it didn't have as much the depth of flavor I prefer. \\u00a0Nevertheless, it was still excellent - far better than any bread you're going to get for miles.The only reason I'm giving this four instead of five stars is just because they're on the way up - and just starting. \\u00a0I know they'll be improving as they get their bearings, and I can almost guarantee that I'll within the next month or so follow up with an additional star. \\u00a0I can't imagine how it could be any different. \\u00a0Tons of good luck to this place!! \\u00a0Very happy to have it in the neighborhood!\",\n",

I loved the huge table they had in their entrance. The employees were extremely kind and explained the sandwich options to me (as it was my first time). The charming smell of freshly baked bread and home-like environment will make you feel as if you're not in a busy city like Chicago. I ordered a chai and a croissant (of course!). I was extremely satisfied with both. The chai was on the sweeter side, but I still enjoyed it greatly.Definitely will make this a regular study spot for me!\",\n",

One of my roommates noted that there was a little French place where I could satisfy that craving. This place definitely delivered! Firstly, it's adorable. I had to add it to my list of places to take bae sometime. It's very cozy with adorable little nooks and leather plush chairs, etc. You kind of walk through the entire place to get back to the kitchen/counter area and the whole thing has a warm, cozy vibe to it. Very happy. In addition to macaroons, they had an assortment of pastries, cheesecakes, tarts, and what looked like quiches or casseroles. People all around seemed to be eating with enjoyment. I ordered three macaroons which were delicious. I actually enjoyed them so much that I saved one for later (I remembered to do this review while at work and gleefully remembering the pistachio macaroon still in my bag, just finished it). They also have a cozy little outdoor seating area which has lots of trees and vines despite being in the middle of an urban area. Overall, a really lovely and eclectic place. I definitely have to go back for their macaroons. They're a great size for macaroons and the flavors were delicious! Plus really friendly staff. Definitely will be returning.\",\n",

The most glaring deficiency with this place is how it's set up. \\u00a0It's at least a ten minute ordeal to get a coffee and like thirty to get a sandwich, especially on the weekends. \\u00a0There is a ton of wasted space on the inside and it's arranged terribly. The counter setup is cramped and nobody ever knows where to go or line up. On top of that, once you order you have to go awkwardly stand in the middle of the floor to wait for your order while they try to serve the next person.If you order food you will be waiting a long time. \\u00a0They also ask you not to wait outside for coffee or food so they expect you to sit there and just hang out for half an hour. \\u00a0I've been here a few times on the weekend recently and ordered food to go, just having coffee waiting in the meantime and they never bothered to call my name for the order. Say there for thirty minutes only to find they just threw it on the counter and let it sit. Cold soggy breakfast sandwiches and awful service on the weekends. \\u00a0If you're going to go, do it during the week off-peak hours where it's not so bad. \\u00a0It's a shame because the products are fantastic but it's so poorly organized and managed that it's impossibly frustrating to give them business. \\u00a0The sad part is that during the summer they'll have tons of people in and out on the weekends with the farmers market, but I bet none will be regulars. \\u00a0Two stars only because of the awesome sandwiches, pastry and coffee.\",\n",

It's also possible they've gone a different direction with the music, but I haven't stayed long enough to tell for sure. Either way, definitely seems like it's improving, and I'm looking forward to trying out the outdoor seating once the weather's consistently nice!_________________________Been here five to ten times over the past few months, always on weekend mornings.The pastries are excellent.The drip coffee and espresso drinks are fine, but not as good as at New Wave or Intelligentsia.It's pretty unpleasant to sit inside for more than a minute, because:1. The bell on the front door, which rings every time someone enters or leaves, is unbelievably loud and piercing.2. The music is generally something like soft-rock hits of 2001 to 2010 (think a lot of James Blunt).3. There's a 100% chance of at least one young child running around and shrieking (not that the establishment can do much about this last one, and it probably doesn't bother some people, but it's worth knowing if you're planning to go there to read or have a quiet conversation).\",\n",

The coffee is great, there's plenty of space to sit, it's contemporary, the bathrooms are clean. You minus well get a whole box of macaroons because they're epic and you'll regret just getting one.

We also tried their sandwich of the day, which we had on a croissant. \\u00a0The croissant was flaky and moist with caramelized onions and brie. Quite simple, but quite delicious. \\u00a0We decided to take a sweet Almond croissant for the road and that was crispy, flaky, and moist as well with the sharp almond flavor. \\u00a0I can't wait to come back here to have another delicious lunch or snack.\",\n",

Maybe the service was off because they just opened, but I can't imagine myself heading back there anytime soon. I ordered two coffees and two breakfast sandwiches to-go and it took 40 minutes to get them. They brought up one sandwich at a time, so I left with one cold sandwich and one warm one. The sandwich in itself was decent but not one worth waiting 40 minutes for. The coffee was good, but also cold by the time I left. I think others there were a bit annoyed too by this, the people waiting behind me asked for a refund leaving before their sandwiches were ready. Maybe I will give it another chance after it is a bit more established and has its service kinks worked out.\",\n",

I knew it would be good, but this was better than good: it was perfect. I'm full but not disgustingly so. Why can't more breakfast sandwiches be this good?!On top of that, they have a Maple Spice syrup (maybe for autumn only?) for coffee which also blew my mind wide open like a delicious epiphany.
