I walked in and reviewed the menu on the wall. Right away a gentlemen came up to me from the back in street clothes and asked if I had any questions. I had a lot of questions. Robert had every answer from time of day everything was prepperd. To the cost of each item I inquired to the penny. He gave me a sample of their version of a donut hole and it was amazing. I grabbed my wife the butter and sugar crepes, chocolate croissant and a hot chocolate. After leaving I was left with such a good impression. I walked back in and asked his name and told him I was so appreciative and impressed by his customer service. My wife and I are both managers at separate restaurants within the city. Most importantly my wife and her friend loved the baked items. We will be back. Thank you Robert for your above and beyond commitment to excellence.

      "        \"review_text\": \"Just moved into the neighborhood and this is the first brunch spot we tried. On a whim on our way out of town this morning we stopped in, in hopes of a breakfast sandwich and my first impression was how charming and social this place is. There were many conversations and work meetings going on, giving this place a warm and casual feel. I ordered the Normandie (croissant, egg, onions, tomato, Brie) and my guy got the Nordic (croissant, egg, avocado, greens, salmon). We grabbed a table and had only a short wait until they brought our plates out. My sandwich was fabulous, definitely would order again, but my guy didn't like his and thought the flavors were a bit off together. I also think it was rather overpriced, he was still hungry after his sandwich and wanted a plain croissant but it was $4, $25 on two small breakfast sandwiches and a croissant is a bit much in my opinion so we passed. Can't give more stars because this place was dirty. Several tables needed to be wiped down, the coffee bar was littered, there were only a few cups left to serve yourself water and each one I flipped was visibly dirty but only semi busy. They also had a basket out on the counter of croquettes with a sign that said \\\"freshly baked croquettes!\\\" which to me and several others read as \\\"sample me\\\" but that was not the case and the staff seemed surprised and corrected us. Sorry but a basket of small hand food with a sign that boasts about them being fresh definitely makes it look like a sample! And for the price I wouldn't buy the pastries without trying them first so it seemed smart to have samples. When all is said and done, this place is charming and I liked my sandwich but I wish it had been cleaner or more reasonably priced. I'm sure living in the neighborhood I'll be back to try more, hopefully next time the weather will cooperate and I can sit outside in their adorable little patio.\",\n",

      "        \"review_text\": \"My girlfriend is from Chicago and has raved about this as a breakfast hot spot. In my mind I was expecting a pretentious, white-glove, sparse portion experience. On my most recent trip back to the Ravenswood neighborhood to visit family, I discovered just how far removed my perception was from reality.La Boulangerie is a simple, relaxed, casual spot that served up a very tasty meal. I had a bacon and egg croissant and my girlfriend had the Nordic, a croissant served with salmon. Her mom had a plain croissant and coffee. I and my girlfriend enjoyed lattes.Our breakfast sandwiches were heartier than I expected, the croissants were fresh and fairly good sized. The greens were crisp, and the lattes were rich and flavorful.We ordered pastries to take back to Ohio. The macaron variety was plentiful and a bit on the pricey side, but they were fresh and flavorful. My girlfriend highly recommended the almond croissant, though I opted for chocolate and some raspberry pastries to give as a gift.I enjoyed the casual atmosphere here. It was bright and cheery, even when it was rainy and overcast outside. We ate at community tables with bench seating, but it was easy to enjoy conversation without having to strain to hear. The people were friendly, too--patrons and employees alike. This was an enjoyable, filling breakfast meal. I will be happy to come back on the next trip!\",\n",

They are SO good at what they're good at... but they struggle so much in other areas that - if they got right - would make them crush it.Their croissants and other baked goods are so so so lovely and scrumptious.....But the second you switch to ordering prepared foods, things have a tendency to fall apart. Obviously these are first world problems but here are recent examples: \\u00a0Ordered a lemon crepe from the menu.... when it came it was plain and the manager said \\\"oh sorry we are out of lemon.\\\" Did they know that when we ordered? Or did it happen after? Why not communicate that to us and give us an option to reorder? Ordered a crepe dish and asked them for Brie instead of mozzarella inside... \\\"no problem\\\" - but it came with mozzarella (and barely warm inside and egg on top was not adequately cooked). Our four dishes came at very different times... my kids were done w their breakfast by the time mine came. Bottom line- it feels like they are one person short and that communication internally could be improved, s'il vous plait!!!\",\n",
