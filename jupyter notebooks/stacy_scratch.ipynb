The only suggestion I have is to potentially have a better system for keeping track of \\\"to-go\\\" orders.

I walked in and reviewed the menu on the wall. Right away a gentlemen came up to me from the back in street clothes and asked if I had any questions. I had a lot of questions. Robert had every answer from time of day everything was prepperd. To the cost of each item I inquired to the penny. He gave me a sample of their version of a donut hole and it was amazing. I grabbed my wife the butter and sugar crepes, chocolate croissant and a hot chocolate. After leaving I was left with such a good impression. I walked back in and asked his name and told him I was so appreciative and impressed by his customer service. My wife and I are both managers at separate restaurants within the city. Most importantly my wife and her friend loved the baked items. We will be back. Thank you Robert for your above and beyond commitment to excellence.

On a whim on our way out of town this morning we stopped in, in hopes of a breakfast sandwich and my first impression was how charming and social this place is. There were many conversations and work meetings going on, giving this place a warm and casual feel. I ordered the Normandie (croissant, egg, onions, tomato, Brie) and my guy got the Nordic (croissant, egg, avocado, greens, salmon). We grabbed a table and had only a short wait until they brought our plates out. My sandwich was fabulous, definitely would order again, but my guy didn't like his and thought the flavors were a bit off together. I also think it was rather overpriced, he was still hungry after his sandwich and wanted a plain croissant but it was $4, $25 on two small breakfast sandwiches and a croissant is a bit much in my opinion so we passed. Can't give more stars because this place was dirty. Several tables needed to be wiped down, the coffee bar was littered, there were only a few cups left to serve yourself water and each one I flipped was visibly dirty but only semi busy. They also had a basket out on the counter of croquettes with a sign that said \\\"freshly baked croquettes!\\\" which to me and several others read as \\\"sample me\\\" but that was not the case and the staff seemed surprised and corrected us. Sorry but a basket of small hand food with a sign that boasts about them being fresh definitely makes it look like a sample! And for the price I wouldn't buy the pastries without trying them first so it seemed smart to have samples. When all is said and done, this place is charming and I liked my sandwich but I wish it had been cleaner or more reasonably priced. I'm sure living in the neighborhood I'll be back to try more, hopefully next time the weather will cooperate and I can sit outside in their adorable little patio.\",\n",

On my most recent trip back to the Ravenswood neighborhood to visit family, I discovered just how far removed my perception was from reality.La Boulangerie is a simple, relaxed, casual spot that served up a very tasty meal. I had a bacon and egg croissant and my girlfriend had the Nordic, a croissant served with salmon. Her mom had a plain croissant and coffee. I and my girlfriend enjoyed lattes.Our breakfast sandwiches were heartier than I expected, the croissants were fresh and fairly good sized. The greens were crisp, and the lattes were rich and flavorful.We ordered pastries to take back to Ohio. The macaron variety was plentiful and a bit on the pricey side, but they were fresh and flavorful. My girlfriend highly recommended the almond croissant, though I opted for chocolate and some raspberry pastries to give as a gift.I enjoyed the casual atmosphere here. It was bright and cheery, even when it was rainy and overcast outside. We ate at community tables with bench seating, but it was easy to enjoy conversation without having to strain to hear. The people were friendly, too--patrons and employees alike. This was an enjoyable, filling breakfast meal. I will be happy to come back on the next trip!\",\n",

They are SO good at what they're good at... but they struggle so much in other areas that - if they got right - would make them crush it.Their croissants and other baked goods are so so so lovely and scrumptious.....But the second you switch to ordering prepared foods, things have a tendency to fall apart. Obviously these are first world problems but here are recent examples: \\u00a0Ordered a lemon crepe from the menu.... when it came it was plain and the manager said \\\"oh sorry we are out of lemon.\\\" Did they know that when we ordered? Or did it happen after? Why not communicate that to us and give us an option to reorder? Ordered a crepe dish and asked them for Brie instead of mozzarella inside... \\\"no problem\\\" - but it came with mozzarella (and barely warm inside and egg on top was not adequately cooked). Our four dishes came at very different times... my kids were done w their breakfast by the time mine came. Bottom line- it feels like they are one person short and that communication internally could be improved, s'il vous plait!!!\",\n",

The veggie special was in dire need of salt- there was so little brie! They forgot the brie entirely on the Normandie sandwich I ordered, and had put less than a teaspoon of caramelized onions on the entire sandwich. The nice lady behind the kitchen counter gave me extra brie when I returned it. It's not that the sandwiches are inedible, not at all, just lacking in something! Perhaps because I am ordering the vegetarian sandwiches? I feel like the addition of one or two more ingredients or sauces, etc would make them stellar.But go! for! the! pastries!\",\n",

The macarons were priced at $2.25 a piece, which is on par with their competition. They boasted a large variety of flavors, ranging from floral to fruity to chocolatey, and both my friend and I noted that the macarons are much larger than normal. Either way, we completely devoured our entire box in one sitting :) My only complaint is that they offer a 5-piece box for $11.90, which is confusing because $2.25 (the price per individual macaron) x 5 macaron = $11.25 total, so you're essentially paying more for a box instead of getting a deal. Weird...Parking is a little difficult, but it's steps away from the Damen Brown Line, which makes it simple to access. I will be adding La Boulangerie to my list of dessert rotations for sure!\",\n",

Even when not fresh as the crust would crack in flakes, the cookie was still soft to the bite with a distinctive chew bounce, just the way I like them. The ganache is not too sweet but flavorful and creamy. I've tried the pistachio and chocolate- both were good. Just wish they were a bit fresher so the outer shell would be softer.Also tried chocolate croissant and a regular croissant. Both while warm, which warms your souls as you bite in. The only thing I'd have to come back for is to see if the croissant has more inner layers when cooled as they stick and taste a bit bread-like when warm. The outer crust is perfectly browned and delicately crisp. Pretty sure this will be my go to for macaron craving days from now on. A bit on the expensive side though at $2.25 a pop.\",\n",

At no point did I feel rushed or pressured to order quickly. After placing my order I waited for a few minutes and then was presented my sandwich in a neatly folded white paper bag.Bottom line - if I am in the neighborhood again I will definitely sample other items on the menu and hope they are as tasty as my morning breakfast sandwich.\",\n",

It has both outdoor and inside seating tables. I genuinely like that there were small macaron samples in the cashier section that customers could try. The price is pretty fair as three macarons, one butter croissant, one chocolate croissant, and one flan cake cost us $15. The croissants are simply out of this world; especially the butter croissant, which I might confidently say it was very authentic French. The texture and surface of the Macaron cookie are silky smooth and chunky, while the cookie's texture beneath the crust is chewy, light, and soft. The filling cream is smooth, sufficient firm just like ganache, and not sticky. However, sugar took over in all of the macarons that we had, which are Dark Chocolate Hazelnut, Pistachio, and regular Chocolate. Sadly, I hardly tasted the flavor and was unable to tell which was Hazelnut and which was Chocolate because of the over sweetness. My friend did not enjoy the flan cake too much. It was smooth, apparently, but the texture was firm. All in all, we will definitely be back here for an ideal Sunday morning just to have a butter croissant and a cup of hot French roasted coffee.\",\n",

The cappuccino was lovely, the community seating was fine, the menu was small and concise. After coffee, I wanted to order a sandwich. I went with the Parisian. The bread was crusty like it should be, but maybe a little too crusty. It hurt my mouth. The ham was great. The cheese was great, but all three together was maybe a little too pricey with a $7 and some change bill. No sides and the size of the sandwich was average.\",\n",

Stopped in at 8 am on a Saturday and they literally had 3 chocolate and 3 plain croissants left. No ham and cheese croissants, no other 'sandwich' type croissants. Literally 6 items in the giant case. I don't know if they were baking them, I don't know if someone got in to work that morning really late, but when I asked, the guy kind of sheepishly said no, that was all they had. I think the people behind me were bummed that I bought 2 of the 3 chocolate ones... That being said, the croissants were excellent. So was the quiche lorraine (they did have a lot of quiche available to choose from). They lose a star for the uneven availability of their goods, and lose another 1.5 stars for the price. I get that the food is good, but the prices are astronomical. You've heard the theory about millenials' inability to buy a house and avocado toast? This is the same thing, but with croissants. My 2 croissants and 1 piece of quiche was $14.50 (including tax). When I was just out of college, I could never afford to get breakfast or lunch here on a regular basis.Great place for an occasional treat of authentic French food and pastries - yes I've been to France 3 times, and going again this summer - just know that everything on their menu might not be available, and is quite expensive.\",\n",

It's a classic French boulangerie (croissants, baguettes, simple sandwiches, macarons, etc), and everything I've had here has been good. It's a great place to pick up a baguette to go with dinner. My biggest complaint is that it is overpriced. For example, a simple butter and sugar crepe here will set you back $6. These are ubiquitous in France and can be bought for a couple euros from a street cart, or even in the US food carts will sell a basic crepe for $3. Other items on the menu are similarly overpriced. I'm definitely happy to see this type of business in the neighborhood, so I will continue to support them. However, the value for the money isn't as good. The only other thing to be aware of is that parking is tough. I live in the neighborhood, so we usually walk. But for those driving allow extra time to park.\",\n",

The food and drinks are listed on boards behind the counters, and all the signage is clear and easy to read. Prices are listed as well, so you don't get any sticker shock surprises.The seating is well thought out and arranged well. I've always managed to find a place to sit and hang out for an hour or so, and I've never felt crowded or hemmed in.There is an French feel to the staff and the food, beyond the name. Well, at least as authentic as it can be to a Midwesterner who's never actually been in France. However, the owners and some staff members are clearly native French. They speak in French to each other, but also speak English very well. The authentic French accent is nice to hear. It does lend a touch of authenticity to the store. Since it's located next to the French school, you also get a lot of students here who speak French to the staff. Of course, you might not like to be around a lot of students, because they are loud and rambunctious. It depends what time of day you come in. The treats especially are as rich and full of butter as Julia Child could ever want. That seems French to me, too.What's inconsistent are the sandwiches and even the quiches. A quick example: I ordered a quiche on a recent Friday. I was very impressed that the staff person took it to an oven to be heated. Not a microwave! I thought this boded well for my lunch. When I ate the quiche, parts were warm, parts were lukewarm, and the bottom was clammy and wet. No soggy bottoms, please! Disappointing.The coffee is good.For pastries and coffee, the quality is pretty high and consistent. The food, on the other hand . . . you just never know what you are going to get.\",\n",

The second time they forgot to warm it up (and I was too lazy to go back and it was still pretty good cold, but nowhere *as* good). Sometimes it's quiet enough that I can sit down and sip my coffee and other times, it's full of screaming children and I can't wait to get my order so I can run out the door away from the chaos.Their macaroons are delicious, but expensive (and buying them by the box is actually *more* expensive than buying them individually, because they upcharge for the package I guess).\",\n",

La Boulangerie is, in my opinion, the perfect representation of all that is wonderful about the food scene in Chicago - diverse, daring and delicious! This is a charming little French cafe/bakery, and the minute you step in, you feel like you've been transported to an actual boulangerie on Boulevard St Germain, Paris. These guys serve up some amazing sandwiches here. My wife and I both ordered \\\"Le Wisconsin\\\" which consisted of herbed chicken, brie, apple butter, avocado and some greens. Not only is Brie my favorite cheese but when you take a bite of it mixed in with chicken and apple butter, you get this intense foodgasm. Seriously. Do try this sandwich, or go for the Atlantic (smoked salmon, horseradish aioli and egg) which is my next sandwich on the hit list. I also saw crepes and quiches on the menu, and will have to try those out next weekend. Also, they serve La Colombe coffee which is second only to Dark Matter coffee in my opinion. ALSO, they also offer a selection of amazing French grocery items. Galettes anyone??? How about rillettes de canard (delicious preparation of duck meat similar to p\\u00e2t\\u00e9)? Bonbons???Lastly, I absolutely love the seating in this cafe. They have one long bench in addition to the classic Parisian cafe chairs you would have found Hemingway lounging on in Paris. If you are looking for a beautiful, little cafe to study, chat or just get a taste of France, do come here and you will not be disappointed!\",\n",

The first time I ordered the Atlantic sandwich it was made perfectly with gorgeous and generous layers of salmon, eggs, greens with all of the layers level. Two more tries on different days and the sandwich was extremely mediocre with sparse filling, limp and wilted lettuce, random bits of egg flung about. That's the main problem here, inconsistency. I thought I had found my new sandwich haunt, but getting mediocre food 66.6% of the time has made me leery.The water available for guests is also rarely kept cool. I did like the breakfast croissants too, although they were prepared really inconsistently from one visit to another.Here's hoping they can up their quality control and workflow in a few months and we'll give it another try to see if it's improved.\",\n",

While the name (Bakery) is somewhat predictable, it only seems appropriate given the authentic food offerings. The crowd was at least half French speaking - possibly staff from the adjoining Lycee Francais School. \\u00a0We went to this new - barely open for a month - location. Street parking on a side street was easy. It's a pretty and bright place in a newish office building. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 THE GOOD: The menu selections and quality of the pastries and sandwiches felt very authentic and are deliciously displayed. Both sandwiches and pastries we tried were meticulously prepared bringing back memories of youthful years in France - like walking into an updated mini version of Paris' renowned Le Drugstore of yesteryear. They do not take shortcuts to achieve high marks for both authenticity and quality. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 THE NOT QUITE READY FOR PRIME TIME: Well, while faced with a long waiting line during prime lunch hour, the line moved rather swiftly towards the cashier. However, the tracking of orders was a mess as we observed about eight of ten orders only reaching their final table necessitating several 'inquiry' stops. Likewise, there is no signage to find the bathrooms - shared across the corridor with the office building - and, once found, one is prompted to go back to ask for the code to the lock.CB\",\n",

Finally today I had some time to go. I knew in advance that I wanted a pain au chocolat, which is what I ordered. The chocolate was tasty, but the \\\"pain\\\" (croissant part of the pastry) was two thumbs down. It looked perfect, had a price tag that said, \\\"I will be nothing but perfection\\\", which I did not mind because I knew that it would be just as it is in France...but sadly was not. No crunch or flake. I ate the chocolate and put the pain, painfully, in the bin.Then why the 5 \\u00e9toiles? The baguette. The baguette. It's somehow so hard, outside of Europe, to find a great baguette. I've heard that it's something about the water - who knows. En tout cas, La Boulangerie has either imported the water for their baguette or made the Chicago water its slave because their baguette is everything that baguette dreams are made of and more... For every disappointing baguette that we've all bought at Trader Joe's, Mariano's, Whole Foods and even the slew of specialty bakeries across Chicago - we have earned La Boulangerie's baguette perfection...(notable exception: the baguette at Sofitel's Caf\\u00e9 des Architectes which I believe is courtesy of La Fournette). So: welcome to Lincoln Square - I'll see you every time I am looking for perfection in bread.\",\n",
