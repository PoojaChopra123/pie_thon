18,Damen,1,6/8/2018,"Just moved into the neighborhood and this is the first brunch spot we tried. On a whim on our way out of town this morning we stopped in, in hopes of a breakfast sandwich and my first impression was how charming and social this place is. There were many conversations and work meetings going on, giving this place a warm and casual feel. I ordered the Normandie (croissant, egg, onions, tomato, Brie) and my guy got the Nordic (croissant, egg, avocado, greens, salmon). We grabbed a table and had only a short wait until they brought our plates out. My sandwich was fabulous, definitely would order again, but my guy didn't like his and thought the flavors were a bit off together. I also think it was rather overpriced, he was still hungry after his sandwich and wanted a plain croissant but it was $4, $25 on two small breakfast sandwiches and a croissant is a bit much in my opinion so we passed. Can't give more stars because this place was dirty. Several tables needed to be wiped down, the coffee bar was littered, there were only a few cups left to serve yourself water and each one I flipped was visibly dirty but only semi busy. They also had a basket out on the counter of croquettes with a sign that said ""freshly baked croquettes!"" which to me and several others read as ""sample me"" but that was not the case and the staff seemed surprised and corrected us. Sorry but a basket of small hand food with a sign that boasts about them being fresh definitely makes it look like a sample! And for the price I wouldn't buy the pastries without trying them first so it seemed smart to have samples. When all is said and done, this place is charming and I liked my sandwich but I wish it had been cleaner or more reasonably priced. I'm sure living in the neighborhood I'll be back to try more, hopefully next time the weather will cooperate and I can sit outside in their adorable little patio.","['moved', 'neighborhood', 'first', 'brunch', 'spot', 'tried', 'whim', 'way', 'town', 'morning', 'stopped', 'hopes', 'breakfast', 'sandwich', 'first', 'impression', 'charming', 'social', 'place', 'many', 'conversations', 'work', 'meetings', 'going', 'giving', 'place', 'warm', 'casual', 'feel', 'ordered', 'normandie', 'croissant', 'egg', 'onions', 'tomato', 'brie', 'guy', 'got', 'nordic', 'croissant', 'egg', 'avocado', 'greens', 'salmon', 'grabbed', 'table', 'short', 'wait', 'brought', 'plates', 'sandwich', 'fabulous', 'definitely', 'order', 'guy', 'like', 'thought', 'flavors', 'bit', 'together', 'also', 'think', 'rather', 'overpriced', 'still', 'hungry', 'sandwich', 'wanted', 'plain', 'croissant', '$4', '$25', 'two', 'small', 'breakfast', 'sandwiches', 'croissant', 'bit', 'much', 'opinion', 'passed', 'give', 'stars', 'place', 'dirty', 'several', 'tables', 'needed', 'wiped', 'coffee', 'bar', 'littered', 'cups', 'left', 'serve', 'water', 'one', 'flipped', 'visibly', 'dirty', 'semi', 'busy', 'also', 'basket', 'counter', 'croquettes', 'sign', 'said', 'freshly', 'baked', 'croquettes', 'several', 'others', 'read', 'sample', 'case', 'staff', 'seemed', 'surprised', 'corrected', 'us', 'sorry', 'basket', 'small', 'hand', 'food', 'sign', 'boasts', 'fresh', 'definitely', 'makes', 'look', 'like', 'sample', 'price', 'buy', 'pastries', 'without', 'trying', 'first', 'seemed', 'smart', 'samples', 'said', 'done', 'place', 'charming', 'liked', 'sandwich', 'wish', 'cleaner', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'sure', 'living', 'neighborhood', 'back', 'try', 'hopefully', 'next', 'time', 'weather', 'cooperate', 'sit', 'outside', 'adorable', 'little', 'patio']",3,0,Jillian N.,0.9893,0.043,0.807,0.15,not elite,212,39

The macaron variety was plentiful and a bit on the pricey side, but they were fresh and flavorful. My girlfriend highly recommended the almond croissant, though I opted for chocolate and some raspberry pastries to give as a gift.I enjoyed the casual atmosphere here. It was bright and cheery, even when it was rainy and overcast outside. We ate at community tables with bench seating, but it was easy to enjoy conversation without having to strain to hear.

21,Damen,1,5/13/2018,"Oooooh I want to love Boulangerie so much. They are SO good at what they're good at... but they struggle so much in other areas that - if they got right - would make them crush it.Their croissants and other baked goods are so so so lovely and scrumptious.....But the second you switch to ordering prepared foods, things have a tendency to fall apart. Obviously these are first world problems but here are recent examples:  Ordered a lemon crepe from the menu.... when it came it was plain and the manager said ""oh sorry we are out of lemon."" Did they know that when we ordered? Or did it happen after? Why not communicate that to us and give us an option to reorder?

The price is pretty fair as three macarons, one butter croissant, one chocolate croissant, and one flan cake cost us $15. The croissants are simply out of this world; especially the butter croissant, which I might confidently say it was very authentic French. The texture and surface of the Macaron cookie are silky smooth and chunky, while the cookie's texture beneath the crust is chewy, light, and soft. The filling cream is smooth, sufficient firm just like ganache, and not sticky. However, sugar took over in all of the macarons that we had, which are Dark Chocolate Hazelnut, Pistachio, and regular Chocolate. Sadly, I hardly tasted the flavor and was unable to tell which was Hazelnut and which was Chocolate because of the over sweetness. My friend did not enjoy the flan cake too much. It was smooth, apparently, but the texture was firm.

While the name (Bakery) is somewhat predictable, it only seems appropriate given the authentic food offerings. The crowd was at least half French speaking - possibly staff from the adjoining Lycee Francais School.  We went to this new - barely open for a month - location. Street parking on a side street was easy. It's a pretty and bright place in a newish office building.     THE GOOD: The menu selections and quality of the pastries and sandwiches felt very authentic and are deliciously displayed. Both sandwiches and pastries we tried were meticulously prepared bringing back memories of youthful years in France - like walking into an updated mini version of Paris' renowned Le Drugstore of yesteryear. They do not take shortcuts to achieve high marks for both authenticity and quality.     THE NOT QUITE READY FOR PRIME TIME: Well, while faced with a long waiting line during prime lunch hour, the line moved rather swiftly towards the cashier. However, the tracking of orders was a mess as we observed about eight of ten orders only reaching their final table necessitating several 'inquiry' stops. Likewise, there is no signage to find the bathrooms - shared across the corridor with the office building - and, once found, one is prompted to go back to ask for the code to the lock.CB","['lucky', 'live', 'times', 'chicago', 'bursting', 'seams', 'new', 'creative', 'places', 'eat', 'la', 'boulangerie', 'exception', 'name', 'bakery', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'seems', 'appropriate', 'given', 'authentic', 'food', 'offerings', 'crowd', 'least', 'half', 'french', 'speaking', 'possibly', 'staff', 'adjoining', 'lycee', 'francais', 'school', 'went', 'newbarely', 'open', 'monthlocation', 'street', 'parking', 'side', 'street', 'easy', 'pretty', 'bright', 'place', 'newish', 'office', 'building', '', '', 'good:', 'menu', 'selections', 'quality', 'pastries', 'sandwiches', 'felt', 'authentic', 'deliciously', 'displayed', 'sandwiches', 'pastries', 'tried', 'meticulously', 'prepared', 'bringing', 'back', 'memories', 'youthful', 'years', 'francelike', 'walking', 'updated', 'mini', 'version', 'paris', 'renowned', 'le', 'drugstore', 'yesteryear', 'take', 'shortcuts', 'achieve', 'high', 'marks', 'authenticity', 'quality', '', '', 'quite', 'ready', 'prime', 'time', 'well', 'faced', 'long', 'waiting', 'line', 'prime', 'lunch', 'hour', 'line', 'moved', 'rather', 'swiftly', 'towards', 'cashier', 'however', 'tracking', 'orders', 'mess', 'observed', 'eight', 'ten', 'orders', 'reaching', 'final', 'table', 'necessitating', 'several', ""'inquiry'"", 'stops', 'likewise', 'signage', 'find', 'bathrooms', 'shared', 'across', 'corridor', 'office', 'building', 'found', 'one', 'prompted', 'go', 'back', 'ask', 'code', 'lock', 'cb']",4,0,Craig B.,0.9848,0.032,0.81,0.158,not elite,0,54

Finally today I had some time to go. I knew in advance that I wanted a pain au chocolat, which is what I ordered. The chocolate was tasty, but the ""pain"" (croissant part of the pastry) was two thumbs down. It looked perfect, had a price tag that said, ""I will be nothing but perfection"", which I did not mind because I knew that it would be just as it is in France...but sadly was not. No crunch or flake. I ate the chocolate and put the pain, painfully, in the bin.Then why the 5 étoiles? The baguette. The baguette. It's somehow so hard, outside of Europe, to find a great baguette. I've heard that it's something about the water - who knows. En tout cas, La Boulangerie has either imported the water for their baguette or made the Chicago water its slave because their baguette is everything that baguette dreams are made of and more... For every disappointing baguette that we've all bought at Trader Joe's, Mariano's, Whole Foods and even the slew of specialty bakeries across Chicago - we have earned La Boulangerie's baguette perfection...(notable exception: the baguette at Sofitel's Café des Architectes which I believe is courtesy of La Fournette).

I knew it would be good, but this was better than good: it was perfect. I'm full but not disgustingly so.

I came in looking for a snack and so I tried the macaroons. Great texture, perfectly super sweet and great tasting. So back to the service. Just that when I asked her about eclairs that didnt have chocolate on top, she looked at me quite judgmental just replying no they only have eclairs like this. I guess I am not the only one who received this type of service. Like she wanted to hurry me up, and if I was deciding on what I wanted, she looked annoyed.

111,Belmont,2,3/7/2016,"I used to love this place, but I'll never go back again, and a rude and lazy employee called Mike who doesn't give a damn is to blame. Bottom line: I was served Quiche blackened underneath with charcoal and grime, not once, but three times, by the same, callous employee. When I brought it to his notice, this is what happened.I used to like La Boulangerie a lot, have been going there for couple of years now because it's on my way to the Belmont stop. The place was formerly attended by a friendly Spanish couple who cared deeply about serving the customers, were involved and engaged. Their croissants and quiches are great and the coffee used to be good too. Besides, it was also a good place to sit and work.I guess there was a change of management about 6 months back or so, and everything started going downhill. They don't even have a proper espresso machine any more, so you can't really order a cappuccino or macchiato. But it was a Monday morning incident that sealed the fate of this café  for me. It had to do with a callous, indolent and rude employee by the name of Mike (or that's what he told me his name was). The first time he served me a slice of quiche, it was totally blackened underneath from charcoal that came from the oven. I told him politely, and he apologized. The second time around when the same thing happened, I was annoyed but told him politely again, and he apologized, saying that he'll be more careful next time. But it should have become obvious to me that he really didn't care. When he did the same thing to me the THIRD time, and this time I confronted him, instead of apologizing or even acknowledging his mistake, he assumed a brazen and defensive attitude and told me ""Now, what do you want to do man?"" as if challenging me. Neither did he offer to serve me another quiche, nor did he give me a refund, but instead walked away with the plate of grimy quiche into the kitchen when I asked him his name, and said, ""Go, write a review on yelp, or call the manager..."" and then muttered something insulting that I couldn't catch. By then, I had picked up my bag and was on the way out. The place used to be great, but the service has fallen significantly since the management changed hands.

Yes, that is a traditional French baguette but made with wonderfully smoky bacon and nutty cheese, made fresh in the bakery and available for only 4.50. A total steal. This bread was amazing. So fresh, crusty on the outside that falls into a nice softness inside. And catching a bit of bacon or cheese just elevates it even more. Mod Dieu--see it's so good it has me speaking French!So I also bought some Macarons to share and found them to be quite good as well. I sampled the Lavender, Raspberry and Passion Fruit. The flavors were true it's name--the filling is my favorite part. The meringue shell had a bit of crunch, but a tad too soft for me.  They are still very good--I wouldn't say no to them at all. The bakery is full of wonderful freshly made choices--the financier and Diplomate (croissant bread pudding)--look really good.  They also offer sandwiches, crepes to order and a really good cafe au lait.

182,Belmont,2,5/22/2014,I'm a daredevil when it comes to just popping into small businesses and trying what they got but this risk was super rewarding.! I was walking to Starbucks on the corner of Belmont & Halsted/Clark. As I pass thru I see one of the employees making what appeared to be a sweet crepe. I am a sucker for a good crepe so I made a mental note to walk back and peep inside. I did and I asked for a banana crepe (they ran out of strawberries but I'm not finicky about food so whatever) and to get that strawberry essence I got some strawberry syrup in it and that took good care for my need of a strawberry/banana combo. Very well done and best of all-- NOT OVERLY SWEET! Most places I've been to make their sweet crepes way too sweet ending with me leaving half behind to be taken home to give away or thrown out. Ate this sucker up! And I feel content. I will be returning with my beloved if I like it he is willing to try it out and I give this place a A. Ps: bought macarons! 5 for 9.99 since each are $1.90. Be a daredevil and try it out :-) but I think the mornings would be more fitting to come here. Marking my alarm the day before coming here for a crepe/lunch date!

We were rushing down Belmont to try to catch a Red line train, but we had to pause for the peculiar. There's a French bakery on Belmont? Eh?We hesitated to go in, but the door was wide open. There was an L-shaped pastry case and a persuasive, jovial French man behind it facing the entryway. He was explaining the shop, how they just opened, ""freshly-baked"", and etc. to another customer. The setup was almost as good as a classic, walk-up bakery window.Meanwhile, my sister and I had laser focus on the same thing... the MACARONS ($1.50 each). We decided to purchase a pistachio one to share and quickly eat in the store. The table seating wasn't comfortable, but any annoyances melted away because the macaron instantly became the focus of unadulterated delight. The slightly crispy outside and melt-in-your-mouth sweet goodness was awesome. Seriously, I think time stopped.Then, two other staffers encouraged us to taste the bread before we left. I'm so glad that we didn't pass up that opportunity either. The bite of the PARMESAN CIABATTA ($4 full loaf, $2 half loaf) was delicious. I decided that this was how bread should taste.

Not only that, the sandwiches sit out all day long and you can see them leaking liquids. I have had a couple of their sandwiches and they are not as good as they make them look.The croissants cost as much as a loaf of bread, and the pastries cost just as much if not more. If I could imagine the prices, I would cut them in half and say they were fair. A large bottle of water cost $4, a simple can of San Pelligrino or Coca Cola cost me $2. There is no comfortable seating and it is obviously not maintained well. The food would be good if it was lower priced, but they do not seem to know how to attract customers. One thing that struck me was that they sell waffles. Not only do they sell waffles, they sell a half waffle for 2 dollars and a whole waffle for 6 dollars. It's minor things like this that make you wonder how capable are these people are if they cannot do any math. The food taste good but when you hear the prices, you simply want to walk away before they try to convince you to buy something you don't want.

245,Belmont,2,10/3/2012,"I've been living above this location for two years so I've seen it as an election office before it was a bakery. When I heard this place was opening up, I got super excited since I love bakeries and french food.They did an amazing job at the construction. The place looks great. The decor is hip, clean, modern. Bread is all over the place which gives it a great bakery feel.The first food display window had quiche, pastries (macaroons, eclairs, creme puffs, etc.). And the  other food displays had salad looking trays, but they're actually sandwich substances w/out the bread. I believe you can choose your baguette. I have yet to try the sandwiches so this review is only for the quiche and macaroons.Macaroons: $1.50 eachQuiche: $4/slice or a whole pie is $15.Macaroons were a little chewey and the flavors were nothing special: Rose, Cherry, Chocolate, Mint Chocolate, Pistachio, CarmelQuiche was alright, they gave it to me cold so I had to heat it up at home. I got a zuccini and goat cheese slice and the taste was pretty good, the downfall was that it was cold.I hope to come back to try more of the sandwiches. This place only gets 3 stars because of the cold quiche and chewey macaroons. I believe this place will take off - they're just starting off.Can't wait to come back!","['living', 'location', 'two', 'years', 'seen', 'election', 'office', 'bakery', 'heard', 'place', 'opening', 'got', 'super', 'excited', 'since', 'love', 'bakeries', 'french', 'food', 'amazing', 'job', 'construction', 'place', 'looks', 'great', 'decor', 'hip', 'clean', 'modern', 'bread', 'place', 'gives', 'great', 'bakery', 'feel', 'first', 'food', 'display', 'window', 'quiche', 'pastries', 'macaroons', 'eclairs', 'creme', 'puffs', 'etc', 'food', 'displays', 'salad', 'looking', 'trays', 'actually', 'sandwich', 'substances', 'without', 'bread', 'believe', 'choose', 'baguette', 'yet', 'try', 'sandwiches', 'review', 'quiche', 'macaroons', 'macaroons', '$1', '50', 'quiche', '$4', 'slice', 'whole', 'pie', '$15', 'macaroons', 'little', 'chewey', 'flavors', 'nothing', 'special:', 'rose', 'cherry', 'chocolate', 'mint', 'chocolate', 'pistachio', 'caramel', 'quiche', 'alright', 'gave', 'cold', 'heat', 'home', 'got', 'zucchini', 'goat', 'cheese', 'slice', 'taste', 'pretty', 'good', 'downfall', 'cold', 'hope', 'come', 'back', 'try', 'sandwiches', 'place', 'gets', '3', 'stars', 'cold', 'quiche', 'chewey', 'macaroons', 'believe', 'place', 'take', 'starting', 'wait', 'come', 'back']",3,2,Justine M.,0.9776,0.012,0.856,0.132,not elite,30,512
246,Belmont,2,10/3/2012,"Very excited to see this place open.  I remember when their Logan Square location was polling customers for possible names of their upcoming Belmont store, and was very excited at the prospect of instead of having to trek all the way west for my bread, I might be able to simply walk a few blocks and within minutes, have it in my stomach.  Yummmmm.... So, when I saw the store open driving down Belmont, I nearly caused an accident pulling over, flipped on my flashers, and walked right in.First, the store is really nice - beautiful, in fact.  They have beautiful sandwiches in the case, much like you might see in a bakery in Paris.  Wonderful looking breads behind the counter, and even though I came in rather late, they had just taken a few baguettes out of the oven, and I was able to pick one up.So, this was their first day open, and I think they need to go through a little breaking in period, but the results, nevertheless, were very good.  I saw a variety of breads behind the counter.  There were plain and topped ciabatta, a variety of baguettes, epis, and batards.  The ""specialty baguette"" wasn't labeled, so I had to ask what they had available, but ultimately, I decided on a cheese batard and an epi.  I needed to point out which was the epi, since none of the four had heard of this bread shape before, but once I pointed out which I was talking about, and it had been retrieved from the shelf, the manager, I think, told me that in fact it was there for decoration, and although they could give me an epi, it wouldn't be up to their standards, an explanation which even now I still don't understand.  But, they had some baguettes fresh out of the oven, so I happily went for one of those instead.  (Point of being very nitpicky - and only because I bake my own bread - I think the single long slash down the middle of the baguette is a little lazy and appropriate for really, really wet doughs.  If you can, I feel a baguette should have the typical beautiful baguette ""ears"" - but, I digress - I think a baguette can be as beautiful as it can be tasty.)The cheese batard was very good, but I think from earlier that day, and definitely up to par with their bread in Logan Square.  The baguette was also very good, but I would say at this point not, maybe, excellent.  I started to think their Logan Square location changed how they make the breads maybe 6-9 months ago, and I think this is the new, modified version.  Don't get me wrong - there is nothing like bread fresh from the oven, and I relished each bite.  This felt a bit like the bread had been made in less time - from start to finish - than maybe some other traditional baguettes (I think longer ferments allow for greater flavor and better results) - the crust was amazing - crisp, crackly, and just delicious.  I tend to also like tangier baguettes, and it didn't have as much the depth of flavor I prefer.  Nevertheless, it was still excellent - far better than any bread you're going to get for miles.The only reason I'm giving this four instead of five stars is just because they're on the way up - and just starting.  I know they'll be improving as they get their bearings, and I can almost guarantee that I'll within the next month or so follow up with an additional star.  I can't imagine how it could be any different.  Tons of good luck to this place!!  Very happy to have it in the neighborhood!","['excited', 'see', 'place', 'open', 'remember', 'logan', 'square', 'location', 'polling', 'customers', 'possible', 'names', 'upcoming', 'belmont', 'store', 'excited', 'prospect', 'instead', 'trek', 'way', 'west', 'bread', 'might', 'able', 'simply', 'walk', 'blocks', 'within', 'minutes', 'stomach', 'yummmmm', 'saw', 'store', 'open', 'driving', 'belmont', 'nearly', 'caused', 'accident', 'pulling', 'flipped', 'flashers', 'walked', 'right', 'first', 'store', 'really', 'nicebeautiful', 'fact', 'beautiful', 'sandwiches', 'case', 'much', 'like', 'might', 'see', 'bakery', 'paris', 'wonderful', 'looking', 'breads', 'behind', 'counter', 'even', 'though', 'came', 'rather', 'late', 'taken', 'baguettes', 'oven', 'able', 'pick', 'one', 'first', 'day', 'open', 'think', 'need', 'go', 'little', 'breaking', 'period', 'results', 'nevertheless', 'good', 'saw', 'variety', 'breads', 'behind', 'counter', 'plain', 'topped', 'ciabatta', 'variety', 'baguettes', 'epis', 'batards', 'specialty', 'baguette', 'labeled', 'ask', 'available', 'ultimately', 'decided', 'cheese', 'batard', 'epi', 'needed', 'point', 'epi', 'since', 'none', 'four', 'heard', 'bread', 'shape', 'pointed', 'talking', 'retrieved', 'shelf', 'manager', 'think', 'told', 'fact', 'decoration', 'although', 'give', 'epi', 'standards', 'explanation', 'even', 'still', 'understand', 'baguettes', 'fresh', 'oven', 'happily', 'went', 'one', 'instead', '', 'point', 'nitpickyand', 'bake', 'breadi', 'think', 'single', 'long', 'slash', 'middle', 'baguette', 'little', 'lazy', 'appropriate', 'really', 'really', 'wet', 'doughs', 'feel', 'baguette', 'typical', 'beautiful', 'baguette', 'ears', 'digressi', 'think', 'baguette', 'beautiful', 'tasty', 'cheese', 'batard', 'good', 'think', 'earlier', 'day', 'definitely', 'par', 'bread', 'logan', 'square', 'baguette', 'also', 'good', 'say', 'point', 'maybe', 'excellent', 'started', 'think', 'logan', 'square', 'location', 'changed', 'make', 'breads', 'maybe', '6-9', 'months', 'ago', 'think', 'new', 'modified', 'version', 'get', 'wrong', 'nothing', 'like', 'bread', 'fresh', 'oven', 'relished', 'bite', 'felt', 'bit', 'like', 'bread', 'made', 'less', 'time', 'start', 'finishthan', 'maybe', 'traditional', 'baguettes', 'think', 'longer', 'ferments', 'allow', 'greater', 'flavor', 'better', 'results', 'crust', 'amazing', 'crisp', 'crackly', 'delicious', 'tend', 'also', 'like', 'tangier', 'baguettes', 'much', 'depth', 'flavor', 'prefer', 'nevertheless', 'still', 'excellent', 'far', 'better', 'bread', 'going', 'get', 'miles', 'reason', 'giving', 'four', 'instead', 'five', 'stars', 'way', 'upand', 'starting', 'know', 'improving', 'get', 'bearings', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'within', 'next', 'month', 'follow', 'additional', 'star', 'imagine', 'different', 'tons', 'good', 'luck', 'place', 'happy', 'neighborhood']",4,3,Adam L.,0.9986,0.025,0.8,0.174,not elite,7,108

The most glaring deficiency with this place is how it's set up.  It's at least a ten minute ordeal to get a coffee and like thirty to get a sandwich, especially on the weekends.  There is a ton of wasted space on the inside and it's arranged terribly. The counter setup is cramped and nobody ever knows where to go or line up. On top of that, once you order you have to go awkwardly stand in the middle of the floor to wait for your order while they try to serve the next person.If you order food you will be waiting a long time.  They also ask you not to wait outside for coffee or food so they expect you to sit there and just hang out for half an hour.  I've been here a few times on the weekend recently and ordered food to go, just having coffee waiting in the meantime and they never bothered to call my name for the order. Say there for thirty minutes only to find they just threw it on the counter and let it sit. Cold soggy breakfast sandwiches and awful service on the weekends.  If you're going to go, do it during the week off-peak hours where it's not so bad.  It's a shame because the products are fantastic but it's so poorly organized and managed that it's impossibly frustrating to give them business.  The sad part is that during the summer they'll have tons of people in and out on the weekends with the farmers market, but I bet none will be regulars.  Two stars only because of the awesome sandwiches, pastry and coffee.","['food', 'excellent', 'coffee', 'service', 'pretty', 'bad', 'half', 'staff', 'pleasant', 'friendly', 'half', 'seem', 'bothered', 'take', 'order', 'glaring', 'deficiency', 'place', 'set', 'least', 'ten', 'minute', 'ordeal', 'get', 'coffee', 'like', 'thirty', 'get', 'sandwich', 'especially', 'weekends', 'ton', 'wasted', 'space', 'inside', 'arranged', 'terribly', 'counter', 'setup', 'cramped', 'nobody', 'ever', 'knows', 'go', 'line', 'top', 'order', 'go', 'awkwardly', 'stand', 'middle', 'floor', 'wait', 'order', 'try', 'serve', 'next', 'person', 'order', 'food', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'also', 'ask', 'wait', 'outside', 'coffee', 'food', 'expect', 'sit', 'hang', 'half', 'hour', 'times', 'weekend', 'recently', 'ordered', 'food', 'go', 'coffee', 'waiting', 'meantime', 'never', 'bothered', 'call', 'name', 'order', 'say', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'find', 'threw', 'counter', 'let', 'sit', 'cold', 'soggy', 'breakfast', 'sandwiches', 'awful', 'service', 'weekends', 'going', 'go', 'week', 'off-peak', 'hours', 'bad', 'shame', 'products', 'fantastic', 'poorly', 'organized', 'managed', 'impossibly', 'frustrating', 'give', 'business', 'sad', 'part', 'summer', 'tons', 'people', 'weekends', 'farmers', 'market', 'bet', 'none', 'regulars', 'two', 'stars', 'awesome', 'sandwiches', 'pastry', 'coffee']",2,2,Matthew C.,-0.6407,0.081,0.858,0.062,not elite,0,11

We also tried their sandwich of the day, which we had on a croissant.  The croissant was flaky and moist with caramelized onions and brie. Quite simple, but quite delicious.  We decided to take a sweet Almond croissant for the road and that was crispy, flaky, and moist as well with the sharp almond flavor.  I can't wait to come back here to have another delicious lunch or snack.","['logan', 'square', 'charming', 'french', 'boulangerie', 'drink', 'coffee', 'eat', 'delicious', 'food', 'small', 'cozy', 'modern', 'looking', 'parisian', 'boulangerie', 'wide', 'assortment', 'traditional', 'french', 'pastries', 'breads', 'coffee', 'tea', 'also', 'substantial', 'lunch', 'items', 'like', 'sandwiches', 'savory', 'crepes', 'big', 'fan', 'savory', 'crepes', 'menu', 'specific', 'location', 'let', 'us', 'customize', 'crepe', 'liking', 'ordered', 'atlantic', 'sandwich', 'style', 'savory', 'crepe', 'came', 'smoked', 'salmon', 'horseradish', 'aioli', 'red', 'onions', 'greens', 'hard', 'boiled', 'egg', 'chopped', 'inside', 'over-easy', 'egg', 'top', 'crepe', 'wheat', 'crepe', 'hard', 'cut', 'times', 'worth', 'difficulty', 'since', 'wheat', 'flour', 'tends', 'healthier', 'white', 'flour', 'flavors', 'went', 'really', 'well', 'together', 'crepe', 'really', 'go', 'wrong', 'smoked', 'salmon', 'horseradish', 'aioli', 'gave', 'nice', 'little', 'kick', 'dominate', 'crepe', 'yolk', 'easy', 'egg', 'soaked', 'crepe', 'also', 'came', 'mixed', 'greens', 'drizzled', 'light', 'zesty', 'dijon', 'vinaigrette', 'delicious', 'bit', 'balsamic', 'drizzled', 'side', 'crepe', 'creating', 'beautiful', 'plate', 'also', 'tried', 'sandwich', 'day', 'croissant', 'croissant', 'flaky', 'moist', 'caramelized', 'onions', 'brie', 'quite', 'simple', 'quite', 'delicious', 'decided', 'take', 'sweet', 'almond', 'croissant', 'road', 'crispy', 'flaky', 'moist', 'well', 'sharp', 'almond', 'flavor', 'wait', 'come', 'back', 'another', 'delicious', 'lunch', 'snack']",5,0,Shanti I.,0.9949,0.022,0.788,0.19,elite,197,158
