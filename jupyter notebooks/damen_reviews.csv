Courtney J.,12/31/2018,5,"Chicago, IL","I adore this neighborhood bakery. It is a few blocks from where I live, so I find myself here on many weekend mornings. Everything is so fresh -- from the made to order sandwiches, to the freshly baked breads and pastries. The delicious smells from the kitchen and the large crowds say it all! I have only been here in the winter, but I imagine the patio would be a great place to enjoy a quick coffee and bite. The only suggestion I have is to potentially have a better system for keeping track of ""to-go"" orders. I've waited quite a while for to-go items that were forgotten by the staff who took my order.",0,1,0,1,[],[],elite,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=aqkJ_0_ILP_myoK5-r2G-Q,263,10,61

I had croissants, tart and a piece of flan from this place. The flan and tart were pretty good though one thing I need to say about the flan is that the crust was all soggy and had an unpleasant texture. The croissants were a little disappointing as they were not so French and more of the American style. They did not have many thin layers and are more bready, heavy and dense.

I walked in and reviewed the menu on the wall. Right away a gentlemen came up to me from the back in street clothes and asked if I had any questions. I had a lot of questions. Robert had every answer from time of day everything was prepperd. To the cost of each item I inquired to the penny. He gave me a sample of their version of a donut hole and it was amazing. I grabbed my wife the butter and sugar crepes, chocolate croissant and a hot chocolate. After leaving I was left with such a good impression. I walked back in and asked his name and told him I was so appreciative and impressed by his customer service. My wife and I are both managers at separate restaurants within the city.

Jillian N.,6/8/2018,3,"Barrington, IL","Just moved into the neighborhood and this is the first brunch spot we tried. On a whim on our way out of town this morning we stopped in, in hopes of a breakfast sandwich and my first impression was how charming and social this place is. There were many conversations and work meetings going on, giving this place a warm and casual feel. I ordered the Normandie (croissant, egg, onions, tomato, Brie) and my guy got the Nordic (croissant, egg, avocado, greens, salmon). We grabbed a table and had only a short wait until they brought our plates out. My sandwich was fabulous, definitely would order again, but my guy didn't like his and thought the flavors were a bit off together. I also think it was rather overpriced, he was still hungry after his sandwich and wanted a plain croissant but it was $4, $25 on two small breakfast sandwiches and a croissant is a bit much in my opinion so we passed. Can't give more stars because this place was dirty. Several tables needed to be wiped down, the coffee bar was littered, there were only a few cups left to serve yourself water and each one I flipped was visibly dirty but only semi busy. They also had a basket out on the counter of croquettes with a sign that said ""freshly baked croquettes!"" which to me and several others read as ""sample me"" but that was not the case and the staff seemed surprised and corrected us. Sorry but a basket of small hand food with a sign that boasts about them being fresh definitely makes it look like a sample! And for the price I wouldn't buy the pastries without trying them first so it seemed smart to have samples. When all is said and done, this place is charming and I liked my sandwich but I wish it had been cleaner or more reasonably priced. I'm sure living in the neighborhood I'll be back to try more, hopefully next time the weather will cooperate and I can sit outside in their adorable little patio.",0,0,0,1,[],[],not elite,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UBsc4RKDogrgpOkwP2YRWQ,210,11,39

On my most recent trip back to the Ravenswood neighborhood to visit family, I discovered just how far removed my perception was from reality.La Boulangerie is a simple, relaxed, casual spot that served up a very tasty meal. I had a bacon and egg croissant and my girlfriend had the Nordic, a croissant served with salmon. Her mom had a plain croissant and coffee. I and my girlfriend enjoyed lattes.Our breakfast sandwiches were heartier than I expected, the croissants were fresh and fairly good sized. The greens were crisp, and the lattes were rich and flavorful.We ordered pastries to take back to Ohio. The macaron variety was plentiful and a bit on the pricey side, but they were fresh and flavorful. My girlfriend highly recommended the almond croissant, though I opted for chocolate and some raspberry pastries to give as a gift.I enjoyed the casual atmosphere here. It was bright and cheery, even when it was rainy and overcast outside. We ate at community tables with bench seating, but it was easy to enjoy conversation without having to strain to hear.

They are SO good at what they're good at... but they struggle so much in other areas that - if they got right - would make them crush it.Their croissants and other baked goods are so so so lovely and scrumptious.....But the second you switch to ordering prepared foods, things have a tendency to fall apart. Obviously these are first world problems but here are recent examples:  Ordered a lemon crepe from the menu.... when it came it was plain and the manager said ""oh sorry we are out of lemon."" Did they know that when we ordered? Or did it happen after? Why not communicate that to us and give us an option to reorder? Ordered a crepe dish and asked them for Brie instead of mozzarella inside... ""no problem"" - but it came with mozzarella (and barely warm inside and egg on top was not adequately cooked). Our four dishes came at very different times... my kids were done w their breakfast by the time mine came.

I have not had a better croissant in Chicagoland.Yet, the sandwiches, in my opinion, always leave something to be desired. I have ordered the veggie special sandwich and the Normandie. The veggie special was in dire need of salt- there was so little brie! They forgot the brie entirely on the Normandie sandwich I ordered, and had put less than a teaspoon of caramelized onions on the entire sandwich. The nice lady behind the kitchen counter gave me extra brie when I returned it. It's not that the sandwiches are inedible, not at all, just lacking in something!

Salena C.,11/8/2017,4,"Chicago, IL","La Boulangerie came through with the sweetest service, spacious seating in both the cafe and patio areas, and delicious macarons. The macarons were priced at $2.25 a piece, which is on par with their competition. They boasted a large variety of flavors, ranging from floral to fruity to chocolatey, and both my friend and I noted that the macarons are much larger than normal. Either way, we completely devoured our entire box in one sitting :) My only complaint is that they offer a 5-piece box for $11.90, which is confusing because $2.25 (the price per individual macaron) x 5 macaron = $11.25 total, so you're essentially paying more for a box instead of getting a deal.

Even when not fresh as the crust would crack in flakes, the cookie was still soft to the bite with a distinctive chew bounce, just the way I like them. The ganache is not too sweet but flavorful and creamy. I've tried the pistachio and chocolate- both were good. Just wish they were a bit fresher so the outer shell would be softer.Also tried chocolate croissant and a regular croissant. Both while warm, which warms your souls as you bite in. The only thing I'd have to come back for is to see if the croissant has more inner layers when cooled as they stick and taste a bit bread-like when warm. The outer crust is perfectly browned and delicately crisp. Pretty sure this will be my go to for macaron craving days from now on.

Quân L.,10/1/2017,4,"Chicago, IL","Located in a beautiful neighborhood in Uptown Chicago, La Boulangerie is a French Bakery that serves croissant, macaron, traditional sandwiches, and hot coffee. It has both outdoor and inside seating tables. I genuinely like that there were small macaron samples in the cashier section that customers could try. The price is pretty fair as three macarons, one butter croissant, one chocolate croissant, and one flan cake cost us $15. The croissants are simply out of this world; especially the butter croissant, which I might confidently say it was very authentic French. The texture and surface of the Macaron cookie are silky smooth and chunky, while the cookie's texture beneath the crust is chewy, light, and soft. The filling cream is smooth, sufficient firm just like ganache, and not sticky. However, sugar took over in all of the macarons that we had, which are Dark Chocolate Hazelnut, Pistachio, and regular Chocolate. Sadly, I hardly tasted the flavor and was unable to tell which was Hazelnut and which was Chocolate because of the over sweetness. My friend did not enjoy the flan cake too much. It was smooth, apparently, but the texture was firm. All in all, we will definitely be back here for an ideal Sunday morning just to have a butter croissant and a cup of hot French roasted coffee.",0,0,0,0,[],[],elite,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=V6x1_b4pzFJ70RtdGwKQYw,18,1146,190

Literally 6 items in the giant case.

I think the people behind me were bummed that I bought 2 of the 3 chocolate ones... That being said, the croissants were excellent. So was the quiche lorraine (they did have a lot of quiche available to choose from). They lose a star for the uneven availability of their goods, and lose another 1.5 stars for the price.

These guys serve up some amazing sandwiches here. My wife and I both ordered ""Le Wisconsin"" which consisted of herbed chicken, brie, apple butter, avocado and some greens. Not only is Brie my favorite cheese but when you take a bite of it mixed in with chicken and apple butter, you get this intense foodgasm. Seriously.

While the name (Bakery) is somewhat predictable, it only seems appropriate given the authentic food offerings.

They do not take shortcuts to achieve high marks for both authenticity and quality.     THE NOT QUITE READY FOR PRIME TIME: Well, while faced with a long waiting line during prime lunch hour, the line moved rather swiftly towards the cashier. However, the tracking of orders was a mess as we observed about eight of ten orders only reaching their final table necessitating several 'inquiry' stops.

Lori S.,8/6/2016,5,"Chicago, IL","Mixed review: I (along with all of the Francophiles & sweets lovers in Lincoln Square) have been waiting since the ""coming soon"" sign went up for the opening. Finally today I had some time to go. I knew in advance that I wanted a pain au chocolat, which is what I ordered. The chocolate was tasty, but the ""pain"" (croissant part of the pastry) was two thumbs down. It looked perfect, had a price tag that said, ""I will be nothing but perfection"", which I did not mind because I knew that it would be just as it is in France...but sadly was not. No crunch or flake. I ate the chocolate and put the pain, painfully, in the bin.Then why the 5 étoiles? The baguette. The baguette. It's somehow so hard, outside of Europe, to find a great baguette. I've heard that it's something about the water - who knows. En tout cas, La Boulangerie has either imported the water for their baguette or made the Chicago water its slave because their baguette is everything that baguette dreams are made of and more... For every disappointing baguette that we've all bought at Trader Joe's, Mariano's, Whole Foods and even the slew of specialty bakeries across Chicago - we have earned La Boulangerie's baguette perfection...(notable exception: the baguette at Sofitel's Café des Architectes which I believe is courtesy of La Fournette). So: welcome to Lincoln Square - I'll see you every time I am looking for perfection in bread.",0,1,4,2,[],[],not elite,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jHO207WK1tA_WC-NeQTsxg,4,16,31

I left with a box of macaroons and a bacon and cheese baguette yes, I said BACON!  I'll definitely be back!",0,1,0,1,[],[],not elite,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GD2HUCFJYzMyA_8sfQvnKA,13,0,5
