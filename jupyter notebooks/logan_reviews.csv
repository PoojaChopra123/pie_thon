Little did I know that I would fall in love with this place right off the bat. The large area for seating (whether it's just a coffee date or study session) is great! I loved the huge table they had in their entrance. The employees were extremely kind and explained the sandwich options to me (as it was my first time). The charming smell of freshly baked bread and home-like environment will make you feel as if you're not in a busy city like Chicago. I ordered a chai and a croissant (of course!).

J J.,10/8/2018,0,5,"St. Louis, MO","Was passing through the area after a lovely stop at Fleur and was craving macaroons. One of my roommates noted that there was a little French place where I could satisfy that craving. This place definitely delivered! Firstly, it's adorable. I had to add it to my list of places to take bae sometime. It's very cozy with adorable little nooks and leather plush chairs, etc. You kind of walk through the entire place to get back to the kitchen/counter area and the whole thing has a warm, cozy vibe to it. Very happy. In addition to macaroons, they had an assortment of pastries, cheesecakes, tarts, and what looked like quiches or casseroles. People all around seemed to be eating with enjoyment. I ordered three macaroons which were delicious. I actually enjoyed them so much that I saved one for later (I remembered to do this review while at work and gleefully remembering the pistachio macaroon still in my bag, just finished it). They also have a cozy little outdoor seating area which has lots of trees and vines despite being in the middle of an urban area. Overall, a really lovely and eclectic place. I definitely have to go back for their macaroons. They're a great size for macaroons and the flavors were delicious! Plus really friendly staff.

Matthew C.,6/29/2018,0,2,"Chicago, IL","The food is excellent as is the coffee. Service is pretty bad.  Half the staff are pleasant and friendly, the other half seem bothered to take an order. The most glaring deficiency with this place is how it's set up.  It's at least a ten minute ordeal to get a coffee and like thirty to get a sandwich, especially on the weekends.  There is a ton of wasted space on the inside and it's arranged terribly. The counter setup is cramped and nobody ever knows where to go or line up. On top of that, once you order you have to go awkwardly stand in the middle of the floor to wait for your order while they try to serve the next person.If you order food you will be waiting a long time.  They also ask you not to wait outside for coffee or food so they expect you to sit there and just hang out for half an hour.  I've been here a few times on the weekend recently and ordered food to go, just having coffee waiting in the meantime and they never bothered to call my name for the order. Say there for thirty minutes only to find they just threw it on the counter and let it sit. Cold soggy breakfast sandwiches and awful service on the weekends.  If you're going to go, do it during the week off-peak hours where it's not so bad.  It's a shame because the products are fantastic but it's so poorly organized and managed that it's impossibly frustrating to give them business.  The sad part is that during the summer they'll have tons of people in and out on the weekends with the farmers market, but I bet none will be regulars.  Two stars only because of the awesome sandwiches, pastry and coffee.",0,0,2,0,[],,,,,,,not elite,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=vIrRhRgMUF7hCIm0aSmqDg,0,1,11

We also tried their sandwich of the day, which we had on a croissant.  The croissant was flaky and moist with caramelized onions and brie. Quite simple, but quite delicious.  We decided to take a sweet Almond croissant for the road and that was crispy, flaky, and moist as well with the sharp almond flavor.  I can't wait to come back here to have another delicious lunch or snack.",0,0,0,0,[],,,,,,,elite,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=shDDyAJPkvKl-44S3VcEew,197,302,158
