Updated review",4,"Chicago, IL","2018 Updated Review:This place closed for several months in 2018 and reopened toward the end of the year. I remembered my delightful breakfast sandwich and rushed back to have it again...but it wasn't on the menu. My Maple Spice syrup was gone too.But! The service I got was comparable to my previous experiences, my chocolate tart was also equally good, and the smoked salmon sandwich I ordered was still good...just not what I wanted.I'll go back again sometime for the baked goods, but I think I'll stick to other places nearby for creative sandwiches and coffee instead.Original Review:They have a Gourmet Breakfast Sandwich that is smoked salmon, a fried egg, avocado, mixed greens, and Dijon mustard on a croissant. I knew it would be good, but this was better than good: it was perfect. I'm full but not disgustingly so. Why can't more breakfast sandwiches be this good?!On top of that, they have a Maple Spice syrup (maybe for autumn only?) for coffee which also blew my mind wide open like a delicious epiphany. It's sweet but not too sweet. It's everything I wanted Starbucks' Maple Pecan Latte to be.I am so happy I dropped in here on a whim.

Hunny B.,5/3/2018,4,"Chicago, IL","I am reluctant to write this review because I understand restaurants and having to deal with so many different types of people, thoughtful and rude. So I really do understand customer service BUT. I really do want to applaud this place for getting me back into loving Macaroons again. There are numerous places that do make them but most dont make the cut. This place, I want to say is on top of my list and definitely back for more.The reason for my minus stars is the lady working there at the moment. It was not busy and around 4-5pm. I came in looking for a snack and so I tried the macaroons. Great texture, perfectly super sweet and great tasting. So back to the service. Just that when I asked her about eclairs that didnt have chocolate on top, she looked at me quite judgmental just replying no they only have eclairs like this. I guess I am not the only one who received this type of service. Like she wanted to hurry me up, and if I was deciding on what I wanted, she looked annoyed. (I understand too that people can be so picky and annoying but if the customer was polite or didn't bother her until she was ready to order, shouldn't you be a little nicer?)Conclusion. Good macaroons Bad customer serviceWill be back for macaroons cravings so hopefully this isn't an issue.",0,0,0,0,[],[],not elite,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NtC8Rn7HLeSI1bzIqnjFTg,5,14,31

Nivek R.,12/28/2017,5,"Chicago, IL","I love French desserts and I've been craving one since I left the French hotel I used to work to. I was heading home then I remembered this place. Here's a breakdown of my review.Ambience: The place is clean and displays look neat. I'm just hoping to have that buttery fresh baking smell when you go inside a bakery. 4.5/5Service: So the young lady that helped me was really nice and just jolly. I was the only one at the store at that time and told her some interesting facts about French desserts. She was so happy and gave me a free financier since I was undecided that day and she really wants me to taste it. I hope I got her name but she looks a lil bit like Sersei from GOT. 5/5 or higher if only I can.Desserts: I got the Lavender Macaron And the lemon Financier. The Macaron is borderline sweet for me. Maybe just a tiny bit cut from sugar but nonetheless still enjoyable. The financier is fantastic. Just right soft, buttery and moist cake. Definitely would go back there for Financier. 4.8/5Pricing: this post is a late one so I can't remember exact price but I remember they are on a pricier side but it is acceptable because La boulangerie use quality products in making their desserts and French desserts. Compared to other French pattiserries, they're competitive price. 5/5.The service of Ms. Sersei gave this place an unforgettable experience and I will be back often just coz of that.",0,0,1,0,[],[],not elite,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=t6MwWJKzFwjrnZEzp360oQ,146,1,4

Lisa C.,10/20/2017,2,"Chicago, IL","I picked up some pastries last night while out shopping to enjoy later at home.  While my macarons were tasty, the cannele they served was burnt on the bottom to the point of being inedible.  The cannele pastries in the case were oriented as to hide the burnt sides.  While these treats should be darker in color from the cooking process, the bottom of mine was like charcoal & and smelled bad....not good!In short, La Boulangerie burned these, still decided to sell them, and hid the burnt side so as to make it difficult to see the poor quality in the case so I did not see until I got home.  It's not like getting a dish that came out of the kitchen with flaws that weren't noticed by the server, there was a series of decisions here leading to selling an inedible item.If you want to try a cannele (which are delicious), check out Spoken Cafe or occasionally Loba Pastry has them.  If you want to patronize an excellent French cafe, check out Maison Parisienne or Vanille Patisserie.  Really the only reason to go here would be grabbing some macarons on the way home if you were already passing by already.",0,0,0,0,['https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_2z4Hf7QZw7HyVkVsDFdog/348s.jpg'],[],not elite,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DYtAwRq69l-wWhlIIXlWxQ,33,10,52

Hana K.,8/24/2017,5,"Chicago, IL","If you order their sandwiches on a baguette, you are doing it wrong. No wonder you guys are complaining! True French baguettes get stale as the day passes that is why French people buy their baguettes early in the morning and store it in a air tight containers almost resembling a small trash bin. Now...you want a sandwich? Order their fixings on a CROISSANT. Their croissants are not super crispy and fall apart crumb trail as you eat like some bakeries. They are layered, buttery and flaky. When they moved from Logan Square to Lakeview, my old co-worker had me buy a dozen of their croissants. She would freeze them then toast them when she wanted one! Their desserts are my favorite (macaron Monday anyone?) and their baguettes I take home and heat it up slightly to make warm again with a bowl of water in the oven. That is the French trick folks! What have we learned:1. Order their sandwiches on a croissant.2. Buy in bulk and freeze for easy breakfast.3. Buy baguettes early in the morning or take it home to warm.

I met up with a partner from an acting class to read through our lines for a scene together. We ordered 4 macaroons and a beverage, paying about $20, which in my opinion is way too expensive. There was only 1 other patron in the restaurant when my scene partner and I were ordering, and they left soon after we sat down. The macaroon was excellent, the dos off putting thing cam from the staff. One hefty ginger woman was working. She was nice when taking our order, but turned out to be the worst part of the place. The lines that my scene partner and I were rehearsing weren't harsh, they didn't have any swearing and we weren't yelling or talking loud. Since we were the only ones there, it was easy to hear each other. We almost reach the end of our lines when I hear ""Can you guys tone it down, or stop or just get out? cause thats really disturbing me"" Mind you, what we were disturbing with our chatter, was her FaceTime call to her friend complaining about her divorce and how her husband left her, as well as her texting sessions that took place the entire time we were there. My friend even tipped her, and to be addressed so rudely from such a nasty woman was not only off-putting but so unprofessional, which added to her unprofessionalism by texting her whole shift and face timing her friend to cry.

Suzanne K.,10/4/2016,2,"Chicago, IL","I moved from the Chicago suburbs/Wisconsin area to the city about 7 months ago and choosing where and what to eat has been the most overwhelming aspect of living in the city by far. I rely on Yelp just as many others do to help me with the struggle, but after having dozens of negative experiences at ""highly rated"" places, it has left me to give my own opinion and La Boulangerie is the one that made me rip out my iPad and say something finally.The menu that is scattered on 3 walls made my eyes hurt, so I quickly decided on the Wisconsin. Chicken, avocado, Brie, apple butter,  sounds pretty safe. I knew something had to be up when my sandwich only took a minute. Here it is. A whole dry hard baguette (how am I supposed to eat a whole dry loaf of bread) --dry shaved chicken like out of the can! No avocado, and two chunks of Brie slapped on there.

Ranit S.,3/7/2016,1,"Chicago, IL","I used to love this place, but I'll never go back again, and a rude and lazy employee called Mike who doesn't give a damn is to blame. Bottom line: I was served Quiche blackened underneath with charcoal and grime, not once, but three times, by the same, callous employee. When I brought it to his notice, this is what happened.I used to like La Boulangerie a lot, have been going there for couple of years now because it's on my way to the Belmont stop. The place was formerly attended by a friendly Spanish couple who cared deeply about serving the customers, were involved and engaged. Their croissants and quiches are great and the coffee used to be good too. Besides, it was also a good place to sit and work.I guess there was a change of management about 6 months back or so, and everything started going downhill. They don't even have a proper espresso machine any more, so you can't really order a cappuccino or macchiato. But it was a Monday morning incident that sealed the fate of this café  for me. It had to do with a callous, indolent and rude employee by the name of Mike (or that's what he told me his name was). The first time he served me a slice of quiche, it was totally blackened underneath from charcoal that came from the oven. I told him politely, and he apologized. The second time around when the same thing happened, I was annoyed but told him politely again, and he apologized, saying that he'll be more careful next time. But it should have become obvious to me that he really didn't care. When he did the same thing to me the THIRD time, and this time I confronted him, instead of apologizing or even acknowledging his mistake, he assumed a brazen and defensive attitude and told me ""Now, what do you want to do man?"" as if challenging me. Neither did he offer to serve me another quiche, nor did he give me a refund, but instead walked away with the plate of grimy quiche into the kitchen when I asked him his name, and said, ""Go, write a review on yelp, or call the manager..."" and then muttered something insulting that I couldn't catch. By then, I had picked up my bag and was on the way out. The place used to be great, but the service has fallen significantly since the management changed hands.

Yes, that is a traditional French baguette but made with wonderfully smoky bacon and nutty cheese, made fresh in the bakery and available for only 4.50. A total steal. This bread was amazing. So fresh, crusty on the outside that falls into a nice softness inside. And catching a bit of bacon or cheese just elevates it even more. Mod Dieu--see it's so good it has me speaking French!So I also bought some Macarons to share and found them to be quite good as well. I sampled the Lavender, Raspberry and Passion Fruit. The flavors were true it's name--the filling is my favorite part. The meringue shell had a bit of crunch, but a tad too soft for me.  They are still very good--I wouldn't say no to them at all. The bakery is full of wonderful freshly made choices--the financier and Diplomate (croissant bread pudding)--look really good.  They also offer sandwiches, crepes to order and a really good cafe au lait.

I was walking to Starbucks on the corner of Belmont & Halsted/Clark. As I pass thru I see one of the employees making what appeared to be a sweet crepe. I am a sucker for a good crepe so I made a mental note to walk back and peep inside. I did and I asked for a banana crepe (they ran out of strawberries but I'm not finicky about food so whatever) and to get that strawberry essence I got some strawberry syrup in it and that took good care for my need of a strawberry/banana combo. Very well done and best of all-- NOT OVERLY SWEET! Most places I've been to make their sweet crepes way too sweet ending with me leaving half behind to be taken home to give away or thrown out. Ate this sucker up! And I feel content. I will be returning with my beloved if I like it he is willing to try it out and I give this place a A. Ps: bought macarons! 5 for 9.99 since each are $1.90. Be a daredevil and try it out :-) but I think the mornings would be more fitting to come here. Marking my alarm the day before coming here for a crepe/lunch date!

I visited on a Tuesday and the flavors offered were chocolate, chocolate lavender, strawberry white chocolate, pistachio, key lime, and salted caramel.I also bought four pieces of intricately made pastries at $6.50 each. With the price came all sorts of fanciness. I bought the key lime, mango mousse, and white chocolate mousse. Despite their different flavors, they share a few commonalities. Each has a custard-like filling with a sweet subtleness clinging onto bits of fruits. They stood approximately two inches tall with two delicate pieces of chocolate atop. The favorite was the white chocolate mousse. The key lime and mango mousse were a bit too sour and citrusy.

We were rushing down Belmont to try to catch a Red line train, but we had to pause for the peculiar. There's a French bakery on Belmont? Eh?We hesitated to go in, but the door was wide open. There was an L-shaped pastry case and a persuasive, jovial French man behind it facing the entryway. He was explaining the shop, how they just opened, ""freshly-baked"", and etc. to another customer. The setup was almost as good as a classic, walk-up bakery window.Meanwhile, my sister and I had laser focus on the same thing... the MACARONS ($1.50 each). We decided to purchase a pistachio one to share and quickly eat in the store. The table seating wasn't comfortable, but any annoyances melted away because the macaron instantly became the focus of unadulterated delight. The slightly crispy outside and melt-in-your-mouth sweet goodness was awesome. Seriously, I think time stopped.Then, two other staffers encouraged us to taste the bread before we left. I'm so glad that we didn't pass up that opportunity either. The bite of the PARMESAN CIABATTA ($4 full loaf, $2 half loaf) was delicious. I decided that this was how bread should taste.

Updated review",1,"Portland, OR","It's hot outside AND inside albeit a fan blowing inside making it still very warm, with flies flying around... I should have known better and turned my ass around,  walking out. But nooooo I wanted a croissant and decided to be a bit optimistic and positive. *sigh* My snobby side from within asked: What is this, a ghetto asian market? Minus the stank? Since flies were buzzing around the couple of small croissants that was left, I thought I'd try a crognut. Their version of the cronut. Service was indifferent and I had to ask for a bag. Do you mind? I don't exactly want to walk down belmont towards broadway in 90 degree weather with a sugary pastry exposed to the sun, melting down into a syrupy mess. Does one not know that about sugar and heat, working in a bakery?! So Stupid. I also sampled a key lime macaron which was regrettable. Read: I totally regretted swallowing. If I wasn't a lady I'd spit it out ASAP. Dry heave it all out. It tasted really old and just.. nasty, not very key lime-ish either. Just tasted very stale with an old, musty taste in my mouth. Nice. I'd want my customers to sample that too, an awful tasting product. That'll make 'em swoon.The crognut; was it worth 5 bucks? HELL No. It was very average and didn't taste very fresh. Glorified, fried croissant in the shape of a donut if you ask me. Don't waste your time, it's not all that. If you're still curious, take a 5 dollar bill out and put a lighter to it and watch it burn.. that's what it'll feel like after you finish this pastry.Hot and stuffy bakery with barely mediocre goods and zombie service?

I tried a pistachio, caramel, and pumpkin macaron. The Pistachio was by far the best.. very good and chewy. I didn't like that it looks like they use a ton of food coloring because these are really bright, intensely colored macarons. I also tried a caramel cream puff with a pumpkin custardy cream inside.

Probably the best quiche I've ever had. I don't like quiche a lot and don't eat it often but I would return for their quiche. It was very tasty. Even crust was very well done! A+ for the yummy quiche.Service staff was very nice, fast and friendly.  The bad thing about their customer service, however, is their price listing.  They list a bunch of sandwiches in different groups on their menu board, but it only provides the customer with a price range for what each of the sandwiches in a particular group cost. I can't stand when a restaurant has a website with a menu on it but do not provide prices, but I'd never been to an actual restaurant that doesn't provide precise pricing for each item. It's like, ""you owe us somewhere between $7 or $8, but we won't tell you how much until you get rung up at the register."" What??? Yes, sometimes I will opt to order the $7 sandwich instead of the $8 one if I'm on the fence and one is cheaper than the other or vice versa if I want one more than the other, but give me a price. Is that too bourgeois of me to ask? Yes, sometime people care about how much money they are spending. Crazy concept I know. Shmm...Prices are high considering that you don't get a lot of meat on your sandwiches.

We tried four different flavors of macaroons, and none of them impressed me very much.

My main issue is that the sandwiches are very expensive and not very substantial. It would be nice if they came with a side and I think the vegetarian sandwiches would taste better on baguettes instead of ciabatta. On my most recent visit I got the mozzarella sandwich which came with dressing. It wasn't wrapped very well and by the time I got home both the sandwich and the bag were soaked with dressing.

The sandwich meat is fluffed or made to appear to look like more, when in reality it is only about 3 pieces of meat. Not only that, the sandwiches sit out all day long and you can see them leaking liquids. I have had a couple of their sandwiches and they are not as good as they make them look.The croissants cost as much as a loaf of bread, and the pastries cost just as much if not more. If I could imagine the prices, I would cut them in half and say they were fair. A large bottle of water cost $4, a simple can of San Pelligrino or Coca Cola cost me $2. There is no comfortable seating and it is obviously not maintained well. The food would be good if it was lower priced, but they do not seem to know how to attract customers. One thing that struck me was that they sell waffles. Not only do they sell waffles, they sell a half waffle for 2 dollars and a whole waffle for 6 dollars.

Adam L.,10/3/2012,4,"Chicago, IL","Very excited to see this place open.  I remember when their Logan Square location was polling customers for possible names of their upcoming Belmont store, and was very excited at the prospect of instead of having to trek all the way west for my bread, I might be able to simply walk a few blocks and within minutes, have it in my stomach.  Yummmmm.... So, when I saw the store open driving down Belmont, I nearly caused an accident pulling over, flipped on my flashers, and walked right in.First, the store is really nice - beautiful, in fact.  They have beautiful sandwiches in the case, much like you might see in a bakery in Paris.  Wonderful looking breads behind the counter, and even though I came in rather late, they had just taken a few baguettes out of the oven, and I was able to pick one up.So, this was their first day open, and I think they need to go through a little breaking in period, but the results, nevertheless, were very good.  I saw a variety of breads behind the counter.  There were plain and topped ciabatta, a variety of baguettes, epis, and batards.  The ""specialty baguette"" wasn't labeled, so I had to ask what they had available, but ultimately, I decided on a cheese batard and an epi.  I needed to point out which was the epi, since none of the four had heard of this bread shape before, but once I pointed out which I was talking about, and it had been retrieved from the shelf, the manager, I think, told me that in fact it was there for decoration, and although they could give me an epi, it wouldn't be up to their standards, an explanation which even now I still don't understand.  But, they had some baguettes fresh out of the oven, so I happily went for one of those instead.  (Point of being very nitpicky - and only because I bake my own bread - I think the single long slash down the middle of the baguette is a little lazy and appropriate for really, really wet doughs.  If you can, I feel a baguette should have the typical beautiful baguette ""ears"" - but, I digress - I think a baguette can be as beautiful as it can be tasty.)The cheese batard was very good, but I think from earlier that day, and definitely up to par with their bread in Logan Square.  The baguette was also very good, but I would say at this point not, maybe, excellent.  I started to think their Logan Square location changed how they make the breads maybe 6-9 months ago, and I think this is the new, modified version.  Don't get me wrong - there is nothing like bread fresh from the oven, and I relished each bite.  This felt a bit like the bread had been made in less time - from start to finish - than maybe some other traditional baguettes (I think longer ferments allow for greater flavor and better results) - the crust was amazing - crisp, crackly, and just delicious.  I tend to also like tangier baguettes, and it didn't have as much the depth of flavor I prefer.  Nevertheless, it was still excellent - far better than any bread you're going to get for miles.The only reason I'm giving this four instead of five stars is just because they're on the way up - and just starting.  I know they'll be improving as they get their bearings, and I can almost guarantee that I'll within the next month or so follow up with an additional star.  I can't imagine how it could be any different.  Tons of good luck to this place!!  Very happy to have it in the neighborhood!",0,3,3,0,[],[],not elite,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=g9ZX9kFcRivZFLoJ25t9cA,7,28,108
