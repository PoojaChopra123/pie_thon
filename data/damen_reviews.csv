0,Jen J.,1/7/2019,4,1,0,"I've been here twice. Located next to the French school.Cute small interior. Have tried their macarons, ham & cheese croissant, almond croissant, lemon tart, and a millefeuille pastry.Croissants fell short of our expectations. Doughy interior. Floriole makes a better ham & cheese croissant.Enjoyed the macarons, our favorite being the salted caramel. Other flavors were passionfruit, lavender, vanilla, raspberry, pistachio, and a seasonal santa chocolate and orange. Sizes varied. Packaged in a pink box for a higher price. There were some oil spots on the box top that I found while walking back home; we were gifting it to my mom so she would understand, but for client or more formal gifting, I would recommend getting elsewhere.Nice neighborhood bakery.",0,0,2,1,"['https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cjkFNdl2ls1zZA-oZt4fjg/348s.jpg', 'https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U83E0Sh55kKeKM48_K7-Tw/168s.jpg', 'https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RVS4jftM2xJF6QjIfsX80g/168s.jpg']",,,,,,,1222,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rr6MSytEzTwMYtkYRwDrlw,"Chicago, IL",2273,553,0.765,0.0,0.924,0.076

I walked in and reviewed the menu on the wall. Right away a gentlemen came up to me from the back in street clothes and asked if I had any questions. I had a lot of questions. Robert had every answer from time of day everything was prepperd. To the cost of each item I inquired to the penny. He gave me a sample of their version of a donut hole and it was amazing. I grabbed my wife the butter and sugar crepes, chocolate croissant and a hot chocolate. After leaving I was left with such a good impression. I walked back in and asked his name and told him I was so appreciative and impressed by his customer service. My wife and I are both managers at separate restaurants within the city.

18,Jillian N.,6/8/2018,3,0,0,"Just moved into the neighborhood and this is the first brunch spot we tried. On a whim on our way out of town this morning we stopped in, in hopes of a breakfast sandwich and my first impression was how charming and social this place is. There were many conversations and work meetings going on, giving this place a warm and casual feel. I ordered the Normandie (croissant, egg, onions, tomato, Brie) and my guy got the Nordic (croissant, egg, avocado, greens, salmon). We grabbed a table and had only a short wait until they brought our plates out. My sandwich was fabulous, definitely would order again, but my guy didn't like his and thought the flavors were a bit off together. I also think it was rather overpriced, he was still hungry after his sandwich and wanted a plain croissant but it was $4, $25 on two small breakfast sandwiches and a croissant is a bit much in my opinion so we passed. Can't give more stars because this place was dirty. Several tables needed to be wiped down, the coffee bar was littered, there were only a few cups left to serve yourself water and each one I flipped was visibly dirty but only semi busy. They also had a basket out on the counter of croquettes with a sign that said ""freshly baked croquettes!"" which to me and several others read as ""sample me"" but that was not the case and the staff seemed surprised and corrected us. Sorry but a basket of small hand food with a sign that boasts about them being fresh definitely makes it look like a sample! And for the price I wouldn't buy the pastries without trying them first so it seemed smart to have samples. When all is said and done, this place is charming and I liked my sandwich but I wish it had been cleaner or more reasonably priced. I'm sure living in the neighborhood I'll be back to try more, hopefully next time the weather will cooperate and I can sit outside in their adorable little patio.",0,1,0,0,[],,,,,,,213,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UBsc4RKDogrgpOkwP2YRWQ,"Barrington, IL",11,39,0.9893,0.043,0.807,0.15

On my most recent trip back to the Ravenswood neighborhood to visit family, I discovered just how far removed my perception was from reality.La Boulangerie is a simple, relaxed, casual spot that served up a very tasty meal. I had a bacon and egg croissant and my girlfriend had the Nordic, a croissant served with salmon. Her mom had a plain croissant and coffee. I and my girlfriend enjoyed lattes.Our breakfast sandwiches were heartier than I expected, the croissants were fresh and fairly good sized. The greens were crisp, and the lattes were rich and flavorful.We ordered pastries to take back to Ohio. The macaron variety was plentiful and a bit on the pricey side, but they were fresh and flavorful. My girlfriend highly recommended the almond croissant, though I opted for chocolate and some raspberry pastries to give as a gift.I enjoyed the casual atmosphere here. It was bright and cheery, even when it was rainy and overcast outside. We ate at community tables with bench seating, but it was easy to enjoy conversation without having to strain to hear.

Obviously these are first world problems but here are recent examples:  Ordered a lemon crepe from the menu.... when it came it was plain and the manager said ""oh sorry we are out of lemon."" Did they know that when we ordered? Or did it happen after? Why not communicate that to us and give us an option to reorder? Ordered a crepe dish and asked them for Brie instead of mozzarella inside... ""no problem"" - but it came with mozzarella (and barely warm inside and egg on top was not adequately cooked). Our four dishes came at very different times... my kids were done w their breakfast by the time mine came.

32,Salena C.,11/8/2017,4,1,0,"La Boulangerie came through with the sweetest service, spacious seating in both the cafe and patio areas, and delicious macarons. The macarons were priced at $2.25 a piece, which is on par with their competition. They boasted a large variety of flavors, ranging from floral to fruity to chocolatey, and both my friend and I noted that the macarons are much larger than normal. Either way, we completely devoured our entire box in one sitting :) My only complaint is that they offer a 5-piece box for $11.90, which is confusing because $2.25 (the price per individual macaron) x 5 macaron = $11.25 total, so you're essentially paying more for a box instead of getting a deal.

Even when not fresh as the crust would crack in flakes, the cookie was still soft to the bite with a distinctive chew bounce, just the way I like them. The ganache is not too sweet but flavorful and creamy. I've tried the pistachio and chocolate- both were good. Just wish they were a bit fresher so the outer shell would be softer.Also tried chocolate croissant and a regular croissant. Both while warm, which warms your souls as you bite in. The only thing I'd have to come back for is to see if the croissant has more inner layers when cooled as they stick and taste a bit bread-like when warm. The outer crust is perfectly browned and delicately crisp. Pretty sure this will be my go to for macaron craving days from now on.

Since it was my first time in the place I asked for a minute to review the menu. He politely told me to take my time and whenever I was ready he would take my order. Perfect. At no point did I feel rushed or pressured to order quickly.

36,Quân L.,10/1/2017,4,0,0,"Located in a beautiful neighborhood in Uptown Chicago, La Boulangerie is a French Bakery that serves croissant, macaron, traditional sandwiches, and hot coffee. It has both outdoor and inside seating tables. I genuinely like that there were small macaron samples in the cashier section that customers could try. The price is pretty fair as three macarons, one butter croissant, one chocolate croissant, and one flan cake cost us $15. The croissants are simply out of this world; especially the butter croissant, which I might confidently say it was very authentic French. The texture and surface of the Macaron cookie are silky smooth and chunky, while the cookie's texture beneath the crust is chewy, light, and soft. The filling cream is smooth, sufficient firm just like ganache, and not sticky. However, sugar took over in all of the macarons that we had, which are Dark Chocolate Hazelnut, Pistachio, and regular Chocolate. Sadly, I hardly tasted the flavor and was unable to tell which was Hazelnut and which was Chocolate because of the over sweetness. My friend did not enjoy the flan cake too much. It was smooth, apparently, but the texture was firm. All in all, we will definitely be back here for an ideal Sunday morning just to have a butter croissant and a cup of hot French roasted coffee.",0,0,0,0,[],,,,,,,18,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=V6x1_b4pzFJ70RtdGwKQYw,"Chicago, IL",1413,213,0.9544,0.016,0.878,0.105

Literally 6 items in the giant case. I don't know if they were baking them, I don't know if someone got in to work that morning really late, but when I asked, the guy kind of sheepishly said no, that was all they had. I think the people behind me were bummed that I bought 2 of the 3 chocolate ones... That being said, the croissants were excellent. So was the quiche lorraine (they did have a lot of quiche available to choose from). They lose a star for the uneven availability of their goods, and lose another 1.5 stars for the price. I get that the food is good, but the prices are astronomical. You've heard the theory about millenials' inability to buy a house and avocado toast? This is the same thing, but with croissants.

They speak in French to each other, but also speak English very well. The authentic French accent is nice to hear. It does lend a touch of authenticity to the store.

This is a charming little French cafe/bakery, and the minute you step in, you feel like you've been transported to an actual boulangerie on Boulevard St Germain, Paris. These guys serve up some amazing sandwiches here. My wife and I both ordered ""Le Wisconsin"" which consisted of herbed chicken, brie, apple butter, avocado and some greens. Not only is Brie my favorite cheese but when you take a bite of it mixed in with chicken and apple butter, you get this intense foodgasm. Seriously. Do try this sandwich, or go for the Atlantic (smoked salmon, horseradish aioli and egg) which is my next sandwich on the hit list. I also saw crepes and quiches on the menu, and will have to try those out next weekend. Also, they serve La Colombe coffee which is second only to Dark Matter coffee in my opinion. ALSO, they also offer a selection of amazing French grocery items. Galettes anyone??? How about rillettes de canard (delicious preparation of duck meat similar to pâté)? Bonbons???Lastly, I absolutely love the seating in this cafe. They have one long bench in addition to the classic Parisian cafe chairs you would have found Hemingway lounging on in Paris. If you are looking for a beautiful, little cafe to study, chat or just get a taste of France, do come here and you will not be disappointed!",0,0,0,1,"['https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2ECiWCvWKa3s5_Jyyg2NCA/168s.jpg', 'https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8QSPftmRN51bbFfUYvqD7Q/168s.jpg']",,,,,,,74,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mLiGd3iVUsrcp-rPWjzdFQ,"Chicago, IL",20,29,0.9891,0.012,0.849,0.139
63,Randy R.,10/2/2016,5,0,0,"Really great addition to the neighborhood. Thus far we have tried the Parmesan batard, a chocolate croissant, a coconut rocher, a Madeline and two flavors of macarons (dark chocolate hazelnut and toasted coconut chocolate). All of the baked goods have been uniformly excellent. Macarons are amongst the best that I've had both in terms of texture and flavor. They also serve La Colombe coffees which of course pair quite well.",0,0,0,0,['https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hpFm466HwdZOyF7r2k9MZQ/348s.jpg'],,,,,,,7,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=G8aYRUDZ5MTWuRCGbple1g,"Chicago, IL",44,178,0.9402,0.0,0.811,0.189

67,Sarah Z.,8/29/2016,3,0,0,"Sometimes the food here is amazing and sometimes it's just not. The first time I ordered the Atlantic sandwich it was made perfectly with gorgeous and generous layers of salmon, eggs, greens with all of the layers level. Two more tries on different days and the sandwich was extremely mediocre with sparse filling, limp and wilted lettuce, random bits of egg flung about. That's the main problem here, inconsistency. I thought I had found my new sandwich haunt, but getting mediocre food 66.6% of the time has made me leery.The water available for guests is also rarely kept cool. I did like the breakfast croissants too, although they were prepared really inconsistently from one visit to another.Here's hoping they can up their quality control and workflow in a few months and we'll give it another try to see if it's improved.",2,0,4,0,[],,,,,,,232,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=u8AElT_dtoqlPwNbVbZqWg,"Evanston, IL",0,16,0.9377,0.04,0.818,0.141
68,Craig B.,8/25/2016,4,0,0,"WE ARE LUCKY to live in times when Chicago is bursting at the seams with new and creative places to eat. LA BOULANGERIE is no exception. While the name (Bakery) is somewhat predictable, it only seems appropriate given the authentic food offerings. The crowd was at least half French speaking - possibly staff from the adjoining Lycee Francais School.  We went to this new - barely open for a month - location. Street parking on a side street was easy. It's a pretty and bright place in a newish office building.     THE GOOD: The menu selections and quality of the pastries and sandwiches felt very authentic and are deliciously displayed. Both sandwiches and pastries we tried were meticulously prepared bringing back memories of youthful years in France - like walking into an updated mini version of Paris' renowned Le Drugstore of yesteryear. They do not take shortcuts to achieve high marks for both authenticity and quality.     THE NOT QUITE READY FOR PRIME TIME: Well, while faced with a long waiting line during prime lunch hour, the line moved rather swiftly towards the cashier. However, the tracking of orders was a mess as we observed about eight of ten orders only reaching their final table necessitating several 'inquiry' stops. Likewise, there is no signage to find the bathrooms - shared across the corridor with the office building - and, once found, one is prompted to go back to ask for the code to the lock.CB",1,1,0,0,[],,,,,,,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9y5tg1eRxzyFWSvaDY2RZQ,"Chicago, IL",0,54,0.9848,0.032,0.81,0.158

70,Lori S.,8/6/2016,5,0,0,"Mixed review: I (along with all of the Francophiles & sweets lovers in Lincoln Square) have been waiting since the ""coming soon"" sign went up for the opening. Finally today I had some time to go. I knew in advance that I wanted a pain au chocolat, which is what I ordered. The chocolate was tasty, but the ""pain"" (croissant part of the pastry) was two thumbs down. It looked perfect, had a price tag that said, ""I will be nothing but perfection"", which I did not mind because I knew that it would be just as it is in France...but sadly was not. No crunch or flake. I ate the chocolate and put the pain, painfully, in the bin.Then why the 5 étoiles? The baguette. The baguette. It's somehow so hard, outside of Europe, to find a great baguette. I've heard that it's something about the water - who knows. En tout cas, La Boulangerie has either imported the water for their baguette or made the Chicago water its slave because their baguette is everything that baguette dreams are made of and more... For every disappointing baguette that we've all bought at Trader Joe's, Mariano's, Whole Foods and even the slew of specialty bakeries across Chicago - we have earned La Boulangerie's baguette perfection...(notable exception: the baguette at Sofitel's Café des Architectes which I believe is courtesy of La Fournette). So: welcome to Lincoln Square - I'll see you every time I am looking for perfection in bread.",1,2,4,0,[],,,,,,,4,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jHO207WK1tA_WC-NeQTsxg,"Chicago, IL",16,31,0.9076,0.086,0.791,0.124
