0,Priscilla L.,1/3/2019,5,0,0,"Oh my goodness, can I give this place more stars? This little French bakery was near our Airbnb in Old Town, and I wish we hadn't waited until the last day of our trip to stop by! I got the hazelnut crepe, almond croissant, matcha macaron, and latte. The service was really nice, and everyone was so friendly. Everything was delicious, and I liked the crunch from the hazelnuts they added with the hazelnut crepe spread. The matcha macaron and latte were really good, but the best part was the almond croissant. It was DIVINE!! They put a delicious almond filling in the croissant, and the quality reminded me of the croissants I loved so much in Paris.One important thing to note is that you will need to put away your own trash and serving tray.If you're around the area, definitely stop by this cute little bakery!",0,0,1,0,[],,,,,,,1,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YK6YZtScjuiQXGHhJmmP1w,"Dallas, TX",18,16,0.9925,0.025,0.705,0.27

I might have just eaten an entire package of chocolate spritz cookies in a single sitting.... Really delicious, to-die-for croissants. So flaky, buttery, and just sheer perfection. Already plotting when I can return to buy more.My only quibble is they seem to use quite a bit of plastic packaging. La Fournette has lovely packaging design (i.e., logo) and of course the clear plastic allows potential customers to easily see the product within. I get that. But I would really prefer that these items were, well, biodegradable for obvious reasons. On a more superficial note, all the plastic detracts from the classic French bakery vibe. So: La Fournette, I am one customer in love with your tasty breads and pastries, and I hope you strongly consider switching to biodegradable packaging in the near term!",0,0,0,0,[],,,,,,,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=96V59tW-8klA28Z0us9eMQ,"Chicago, IL",0,4,0.9841,0.0,0.801,0.199

This beautiful French cafe is absolutely beautiful from the outside and in. I arrived really late, around 6:24 and they close at 6:30 so I was relieved to see that they are not the type of place to close extra early just because they may not have as many customers. I literally squealed from joy when I walked in and told the employees I had rushed here from water tower to try their delicious macaroons! I had two- the chocolate and lychee. I also spied a raspberry beignet. When you check in, you get a free macaroon so for the two macaroons and French beignet, the total was $5.56? Pretty good deal if you ask me. I was blown away by the ambiance, everything is wooden and cute. My only regret is that I didn't get a chance to stay longer and explore. I ate the raspberry beignet on my way out- I've made beignets before and they are best straight out of the oven so I wasn't completely disappointed when they had lost some of their freshness by 6:30 at night- they had probably been out for almost twelve hours anyways. The raspberry jam was very delicious, it tasted very organic and the dough of the beignet was not thick. It was cooked perfectly and the dough did not overpower the filling!

First time being in a French bakery, there were so many options to choose from in terms of sweets-like macarons, danishes,  beignets(which honestly seems like a pricer version of Pączki!), sandwiches and breads. The server was very helpful in pointing out what macarons flavor was which! Prices seem reasonable for portion! Service was excellent! I enjoyed getting a box of 12 assorted macarons, apricot danish, and raspberry and hazelnut beignets!

I've got to knock off a star for service.  It's not that the service is slow, it's just like, so blah.  Every time I walk in here (both locations), I feel like the people behind the counter look at me like I'm from another planet and they don't know what a human is.  Straight deer in headlights look! No ""hey!! Welcome to La Fournette! What can I get you???"".

I love this place's quiche, baked goods, and of course their macarons, which are cheaper than other French patisseries in the area. Service & atmosphere: the place has counter service and the staff yesterday were very friendly, warm, and informative. The place has a French countryside rustic vibe, and we sat outside in the small patio, which was perfect for the one of 5 sunny days this spring. Food: Between three people, we shared coffee and chocolate madeleines, a chicken and spinach quiche, a nicoise salad, and an almond croissant. I got a free espresso macaron with Yelp check-in, it was so delicious and perfectly baked, and I obviously wasn't going to share it with anyone. The madeleines were dense and fluffy, and the chocolate ones were especially flavorful. The nicoise salad was fine, but the quiche was creamy and had a buttery flaky crust. The almond croissant was the BEST I've ever had. Crispy, flakiness on the outside with soft, light insides and a generous amount of sweet almond paste. It was so good that I will absolutely be back just for macarons and croissant the next time I'm in need of French baked goods.",3,3,4,1,['https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oBMzMM1CuqiNwsR2r6SM7w/348s.jpg'],,,,,,,418,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=M5CDadStKmQxLJPTBGBf0Q,"Fremont, CA",693,348,0.9902,0.013,0.802,0.185

I was suprised and wondered to myself how long the sandwiches sat there before they are bought. I took my sandwich to go, and I should have looked at it before hand, because when I got home, my heart sank.The sandwich came with mustard, hazelnuts, and micro-greens, and to my dismay, the portion itself was Micro-sized. The flavors of the salami, mustard, and hazelnuts were lost in the oversized bread- but I did enjoy the baguette.This was the lightest, thinnest sandwich I have ever had!

We had the quinoa salad which was very flavorful and the veggie crepe which was incredible! It was filled with this fantastic French cheese I had never heard of but unlike anything I've ever tasted.
